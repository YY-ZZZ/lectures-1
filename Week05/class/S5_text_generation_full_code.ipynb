              "{'trump_speeches.txt': b'Thank you so much.  That\\'s so nice.  Isn\\'t he a great guy.  He doesn\\'t get a fair press; he doesn\\'t get it.  It\\'s just not fair.  And I have to tell you I\\'m here, and very strongly here, because I have great respect for Steve King and have great respect likewise for Citizens United, David and everybody, and tremendous resect for the Tea Party.  Also, also the people of Iowa.  They have something in common.  Hard-working people.  They want to work, they want to make the country great.  I love the people of Iowa.  So that\\'s the way it is.  Very simple.\\nWith that said, our country is really headed in the wrong direction with a president who is doing an absolutely terrible job.  The world is collapsing around us, and many of the problems we\\'ve caused.  Our president is either grossly incompetent, a word that more and more people are using, and I think I was the first to use it, or he has a completely different agenda than you want to know about, which could be possible.  In any event, Washington is broken, and our country is in serious trouble and total disarray.  Very simple.  Politicians are all talk, no action.  They are all talk and no action.  And it\\'s constant; it never ends.\\nAnd I\\'m a conservative, actually very conservative, and I\\'m a Republican.  And I\\'m very disappointed by our Republican politicians.  Because they let the president get away with absolute murder.  You see always, oh we\\'re going to do this, we\\'re going to--.  Nothing ever happens; nothing ever happens.\\nYou look at Obamacare.  A total catastrophe and by the way it really kicks in in \\'16 and it is going to be a disaster.  People are closing up shops.  Doctors are quitting the business.  I have a friend of mine who\\'s a doctor, a very good doctor, a very successful guy.  He said, I have more accountants than I have patients.  And he needs because it is so complicated and so terrible and he\\'s never had that before and he\\'s going to close up his business.  And he was very successful guy.  But it\\'s happening more and more.\\nLook at Obamacare with a $5 billion website.  I have many websites, many, many websites.  They\\'re all over the place.  But for $10, okay?\\nNow everything about Obamacare was a lie.  It was a filthy lie.  And when you think about it, lies, I mean are they prosecuted?  Does anyone do anything?  And what are the Republican politicians doing about it?  He lied about the doctor, he lied about every aspect.  You can keep your plan.  And you\\'ve all heard that hundreds of times.  That\\'s like the real estate location, location.  I don\\'t even say it anymore because everybody goes location, location.  But you have heard this about Obamacare.\\nAnd it\\'s disgraceful.  It\\'s a big, fat, horrible lie.  Your deductibles are going through the roof.  You\\'re not going to get--unless you\\'re hit by an army tank, you\\'re not going to get coverage.  And people that had plans that they loved, that they really loved, don\\'t have those plans anymore.  So it\\'s a real, real disaster.  And somebody has to repeal and replace Obamacare.  And they have to do it fast and not just talk about it.\\nNow, we have to build a fence.  And it\\'s got to be a beauty.  Who can build better than Trump?  I build; it\\'s what I do.  I build; I build nice fences, but I build great buildings.  Fences are easy, believe me.  I saw the other day on television people just walking across the border.  They\\'re walking.  The military is standing there holding guns and people are just walking right in front, coming into our country.  It is so terrible.  It is so unfair.  It is so incompetent.  And we don\\'t have the best coming in.  We have people that are criminals, we have people that are crooks.  You can certainly have terrorists.  You can certainly have Islamic terrorists.  You can have anything coming across the border.  We don\\'t do anything about it.  So I would say that if I run and if I win, I would certainly start by building a very, very powerful border.\\nAgain, the politicians talk about it and they do nothing about it.  Benghazi.  Oh, Benghazi, Benghazi.  Everything is Benghazi.  What happens?  Nothing.\\nIRS, e-mails.  I get sued all the time, okay.  I run a big business.  You know I\\'ve always said it\\'s very, very hard for a person who is very successful.  I have done so many deals.  Almost all of them have been tremendously successful.  You\\'ll see that when I file my statements.  I mean you will see; you will be very proud of me, okay.  But I\\'ve always said, and I said it strongly, it\\'s very hard for somebody that does tremendous numbers of deals to run for politics, run for political office, any office, let alone president.  Because you\\'ve done so much; you\\'ve beaten so many people; you\\'ve created so many--  Look, Obama, what did he do?  No deal.  He never did a deal.  He did one deal.  A house.  And if you did that house you\\'d be in jail right now, okay.  He got away with murder.  But I can tell you, e-mails.  IRS, the e-mails, thousands of them, they were lost; they were lost.  If you were in my world you would know that e-mails can\\'t be lost; they can\\'t be lost.  So why aren\\'t our politicians finding out where those e-mails are?\\nThey talk about executive orders and they talk about immigration and they talk about oh well we have to stop the border; that\\'s the end of it.  Believe me if I did something you would have a border that would be great.  But they talk about it.  And then you have a president that does an executive order.  Nobody even heard of an executive order.  He does it to let people come in and nobody does anything about executive orders.  Why didn\\'t they go to court and ask for declaratory judgment--which is something that when you know somebody is going to go after you and when it\\'s in writing, and he\\'s been saying it for a long time; he said, I\\'m going to approve this and that--why didn\\'t our Republicans go in and get a declaratory judgment from the courts because you could have started the process six months earlier.  Instead they have a weak lawsuit, that probably the time it\\'s finished, I know so much about this, six, seven, eight years from now everyone\\'s going to forget about it.  We\\'ll be into a different mode, and our country will be further destroyed.  So we have to do something.\\nJobs.  China.  I mean I\\'ve made so much money fighting against the Chinese.  One of the best deals I ever did was against the Chinese, and they respect me for it.  And I know them.  And they say, we can\\'t believe what we\\'re getting away with.  We can\\'t believe how stupid your leaders are.  They tell me that.  Now they don\\'t know I\\'m going to go and make a speech about it, but why not.  But they tell me that.\\nAnd by the way, especially for the folks here that sell so much--goods, I mean the goods you sell are incredible; I don\\'t know if you\\'ve been watching what\\'s happening with the devaluations of so many countries.  The Euro, China is going crazy with the devaluation.  I never thought that they\\'d have the guts to do what they\\'re doing.  They are devaluing down to nothing.  And what it\\'s going to do is make it impossible for you to sell your product; it\\'s going make it impossible for you to compete.  And they\\'re getting away with it.  And they wouldn\\'t have even done it two years ago, but now they feel we\\'re so weak and we have so many different problems all over the world that they can do it.  But you watch this devaluation of all of it.  I mean the Euro, China, Mexico; everybody is devaluing.  And when you hear the dollar is getting stronger, it sounds good.  You know it\\'s one of those things, sounds good.  Be very careful.  Be very careful.  Because we\\'re just going to lose more and more business to these foreign countries that really know what they are doing.  They have it set.  Don\\'t forget another thing.  China became the number one economic power a year ago.  That was unthinkable; to think that that was going to happen.  It was absolutely unthinkable.  So it happened and it\\'s very, very sad.\\nNow we spent $2 trillion in Iraq.  We got nothing.  They don\\'t even respect us; they don\\'t even care about us.  Until they started getting their ass kicked, and call, oh please come back and help us.  We want you out; then all of the sudden a new group forms, ISIS.  By the way, you know how they formed.  They took the oil.  And for those of you that know and love Donald Trump--there are some of you--have I been saying for four years, keep the oil.  So now ISIS has the oil.  And the stuff that ISIS doesn\\'t have, Iran is going to take.  So we get nothing.  We have $2 trillion and we have thousands of lives lost, thousands, and we have, what do we have.  I mean I walk down the streets of New York and I see so many wounded warriors, incredible people.  And we have to help those people, we have to help our vets, we have to help our military, we have to build our military.  But, and we have to do it fast; we have to do it fast.  We have incompetent people.  They put people in charge that have no clue what they\\'re doing.  It needs money.\\nWe have to make our country rich again so we do that, so we can save Social Security.  \\'Cause I\\'m not a cutter; I\\'ll probably be the only Republican that does not want to cut Social Security.  I\\'m not a cutter of Social Security; I want to make the country rich so that Social Security can be afforded, and Medicare and Medicaid.  Get rid of the waste, get rid of the fraud, but you deserve your Social Security; you\\'ve been paying your Security.  And like, I like Congressman Ryan, I like a lot of the people that are talking about you know cutting Social Security, and by the way the Democrats are eating your lunch on this issue.  It\\'s an issue that you\\'re not going to win; you\\'ve got to make the country rich again and strong again so that you can afford it, and so you can afford military, and all of the other things.\\nNow, we have a game changer now, and the game changer is nuclear weapons.  We really do have to get strong, and we have to get strong fast.  We can\\'t let Iran get a nuclear weapon.  We can\\'t do it.  Can\\'t do it.  We cannot let that happen.  You know in the old days, I would have said 100 years ago, 50 years ago, 30 years ago, pull out and let them fight each other.\\nHere we are in Syria.  We\\'re fighting people that want to overturn Syria.  Think of this.  We\\'re fighting ISIS, but ISIS wants to overturn the government.  Maybe you let them fight for a little while and then you take out the one that remains, okay.  But think of it; think of it.  ISIS is fighting them and we are bombing the hell out of them, but we want Syria to fall.  There are so many things; there are so many things.\\nBut the one game changer that we have to be careful with, that we never really had to think about  too much before, other than a cetain number of years ago, is the nuclear.  Nuclear today, it\\'s not like soldiers in uniforms shooting rifles.  You can take out the East Coast of this country, you can take out large sections of the Midwest, you can take out things that were unthinkable.  The power.  And we have to be in a position where that never, ever, ever, every happens.  We\\'ve never had this before.\\nWe have a situation in Afghanistan; we\\'re spending tremendous amounts of money there.  We\\'re trying to do the right thing.  We have leadership, again--no leadership respects us.  You know, leadership of other places never respect stupid people, okay, that\\'s one thing you\\'re going to find.  The same thing is happening there.  And I never knew that Afghanistan until a year ago or so, Afghanistan has tremendous wealth in minerals, different, not the oil, but minerals.  And we\\'re fighting here, and on the other side of the mountain China is taking out all the minerals.  They\\'re taking it out.  Trillion of dollars and millions of dollars of minerals.  So we\\'re fighting here and they are taking it out, looking at us and saying thank you very much sucker.  It\\'s really, really crazy.\\nSo we have to rebuild quickly our infrastructure of this country.  If we don\\'t--  The other day in Ohio a bridge collapsed.  Bridges are collapsing all over the country.  The reports on bridges and the like are unbelievable, what\\'s happening with our infrastructure.\\nI go to Saudi Arabia, I go to Dubai; I am doing big jobs in Dubai.  I go to various different places.  I go to China.  They are building a bridge on every corner.  They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge like small time stuff.  They\\'re building the most incredible things you have ever seen.  They are building airports in Qatar--which they like to say \"cutter\" but I\\'ve always said \"qatar\" so I\\'ll keep it \"qatar\" what the hell.  But they\\'re building, they\\'re building an airport and have just completed an airport the likes of which you have never seen, in Dubai an airport the likes of which you have never seen.  And then I come back to LaGuardia where the runways have potholes.  The place is falling apart.  You go into the main terminal and they have a terraza floor that\\'s so old it\\'s falling apart.  And they have a hole in it, and they replace it with asphalt.  So you have a white terraza floor and they put asphalt all over the place.  This is inside, not outside.  And I just left Dubai where they have the most incredible thing you\\'ve ever seen.  In fact my pilot said oh Mr. Trump this is such an honor.  I said it\\'s not an honor; they\\'re just smart.  But you look at LAX, and you look at Kennedy Airport, and you look at our airports generally, you look at our roadways where they\\'re crumbling.\\nYou look at all of the things that are bad--  I\\'ll give you an example. And this isn\\'t part of what I was going to say, but I ride down the highways and somebody makes those guard rails.  You know the guard rails.  The ones that sort of go like this [demonstrates with hand] that are always  bent, rusted and horrible.  Did you ever see more than like 20 feet which isn\\'t corroded, or bent or the heat, if it gets too hot, it just crushes.  Now they\\'ve been selling this thing for 25 years.  Why doesn\\'t someone stop them and get something that works.  Because they don\\'t know; they don\\'t know what\\'s happening.  Somebody made a lot of money on that.  They don\\'t know what is happening.\\nSo we have to make our country great again.  We have to rebuild our country.  And we have a long way to go.  We are just in such serious trouble because we owe so much money.  Now we owe it to the Chinese, a lot of it.  We owe it to other countries.  They\\'re the ones that hold the debt.  And then we give them money.  We have countries that we owe money to and yet we\\'re giving them subsidies.  I just ordered thousands of television sets and between LG and Samsung and I mean you know--  No American company comes to see and comes to bid.  It\\'s South Korea, and whenever they have a problem we send the battleships, we send the destroyers, we send our airplanes, we\\'re going to protect them.  What are we doing; why aren\\'t they paying us?  Why aren\\'t they paying us; what are we doing?  I order thousands and thousands of sets all the time, for some reason it\\'s South Korea.  You know whether it\\'s China, South Korea, but in this case televisions, South Korea.  Why aren\\'t they doing something to justify what is going on?\\nNow, we have a very important election coming up.  We have a presidential election coming up. And we have some good people.  Nobody like Trump of course, but these are minor details.  We have some good people.\\nIt\\' can\\'t be Mitt because Mitt ran and failed.  He failed.  I mean I liked him.  Look--like him, dislike him--the 47% statement that he made, that\\'s not going away.  The Romneycare from Massachusetts, that\\'s not going away.  What do you think they\\'re going to say oh we won\\'t bring that up this time.  It\\'s not fair because it was a long t--  That doesn\\'t work.  But more importantly, he choked.  Something happened to him in the last month.  He had that election won.  And let me tell you something.  That election, sort of like a dealmaker that can\\'t close the deal.  I know many of those guys; they get it up to the one-yard line, they go ah, ah I can\\'t close it.  Or a golfer that can\\'t sink the three-footer to win the tournament.  And there are many of them.  Most people are like that; I mean most people are like that.  You can\\'t give somebody another chance, \\'cause actually I think this election is tougher to win than beating a failed president.  I really do.  I think beating Obama would have been a much easier one than the one that\\'s coming up, which is sad to say but true.  So you can\\'t have Romney.  He choked.\\nYou can\\'t have Bush.  The last thing we need is another Bush.  Now I made that statement very strongly, and now every one says the last thing--  You know they copied it.  I\\'ll be accused of copying the statement; that\\'s the bad thing.  But I said it.  I was the one that said it first, and I mean it.  The last thing we need is another Bush.  Now, he\\'s totally in favor of Common Core; that\\'s a disaster, that\\'s bad, it should be local and all of that.  But he\\'s totally in favor of Common Core.  He\\'s very, very weak on immigration.  Don\\'t forget--remember his statement--they come for love.  I say, what?  Come for love?  You\\'ve got these people coming, half of them are criminals.  They\\'re coming for love?  They\\'re coming for a lot of other reasons, and it\\'s not love.  And when he runs, you got to remember his brother really gave us Obama.  I was never a big fan, but his brother gave us Obama.  \\'Cause Abraham Lincoln coming home back from the dead could not have won the election because it was going so badly and the economy was just absolutely in shambles that last couple of months.  And then he appointed Justice Roberts.  And Jeb wanted Justice Roberts.  And Justice Roberts basically approved Obamacare in a shocking decision that nobody believes.  So you can\\'t have Jeb Bush.  And he\\'s going to lose aside from that; he\\'s not going to win.  So Mitt and--you just can\\'t have those two.  That\\'s it.  That\\'s it.  It\\'s so simple.\\nSo just in summing up and I just wrote a few of these little points down because it\\'s very important.  And I watch these teleprompters, and by the way I think any president candidate that runs should not be allowed to use a teleprompter, because we got one that uses teleprompters.  And people say, oh he is so quick on his feet.  He is reading it.  I mean give me a break.  Everything is read.  You don\\'t really test the mettle of a man or a woman unless they can get up on stage and talk.  And that\\'s what we ended up getting--the king of teleprompters.  But, so when I look at these things here I say you know what, it\\'s so much easier, it would be so nice, just bah, pa, bah, pa, bah, bing, bing, bing.  No problems, get off stage, everybody falls asleep and that\\'s the end of that.  But we have to do something about these teleprompters.\\nBut in looking at these situations--  I built an incredible company.  And you\\'ll see that.  An incredible company; a wonderful company.  I employ thousands of people and I love doing what I\\'m doing.  And in a certain way, I wish I weren\\'t doing this, but our country is in such trouble and would be so easy to fix.  We have such great potential.\\nSo if I run for president and if I win, I would totally succeed in:\\ncreating jobs;\\ndefeating ISIS and stopping the Islamic terrorists--and you have to do that;\\nreducing the budget deficit--so important, have to do it;\\nsecuring our Southern border--and I mean seriously securing it;\\nstopping nuclear weapons in Iran and elsewhere;\\nsaving Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, without cutting it down to the bone because it\\'s not fair to people that have been paying for their whole lives and other people and it\\'s not fair to future people coming up, and we can do it;\\nrepealing Obamacare and replacing it with something far better for the people, and far less expensive, both for the people and for the country.  And believe me there are plans that are so much better for everybody.  And everybody can be covered.  I\\'m not saying leave 50-percent of the people out.  Everybody can be c-- This plan is just a basic disaster.  Nobody knows.  As bad as the website was, this is how bad the plan itself is;\\nfixing our country\\'s infrastructure, our bridges, our schools, our highways, our airports.  And that, I can tell you, nobody is close to Trump.  I just got the best hotel in North America.  I\\'m building, which is sort of interesting, think of this one.  I\\'m building one of the great hotels of the world on Pennsylvania Avenue, right opposite the White House, between the White House and Congress.  Right on Penn.--  The  Old Post Office site, and I got it from Obama.  Do you believe that?  And everybody wanted it.  So, I can\\'t believe it myself.  But it\\'s going to be fantastic;\\nand so many other things.\\nI know what needs to be done to make America great again.  We can make this country great again.  The potential is enormous.  And I am serious thinking of running for president because I can do the job.\\nThank you all very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much, everybody.  Thank you.  Beautiful.  Thank you.\\nThank you for the opportunity to speak to you, and thank you to the Center for National Interest for honoring me with this invitation. It truly is a great honor. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country, one that replaces randomness with purpose, ideology with strategy, and chaos with peace.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time to shake the rust off America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s foreign policy. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold, something we have to do. The direction I will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle. My foreign policy will always put the interests of the American people and American security above all else. It has to be first. Has to be.\\nThat will be the foundation of every single decision that I will make.\\nAmerica First will be the major and overriding theme of my administration. But to chart our path forward, we must first briefly take a look back. We have a lot to be proud of.\\nIn the 1940s we saved the world. The greatest generation beat back the Nazis and Japanese imperialists. Then we saved the world again. This time, from totalitarianism and communism. The Cold War lasted for decades but, guess what, we won and we won big. Democrats and Republicans working together got Mr. Gorbachev to heed the words of President Reagan, our great president, when he said, tear down this wall.\\nHistory will not forget what he did. A very special man and president. Unfortunately, after the Cold War our foreign policy veered badly off course. We failed to develop a new vision for a new time. In fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense. Logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, which led to one foreign policy disaster after another.\\nThey just kept coming and coming. We went from mistakes in Iraq to Egypt to Libya, to President Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s line in the sand in Syria. Each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper. Very bad. It all began with a dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interests in becoming a western democracy.\\nWe tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed. Civil war, religious fanaticism, thousands of Americans and just killed be lives, lives, lives wasted. Horribly wasted. Many trillions of dollars were lost as a result. The vacuum was created that ISIS would fill. Iran, too, would rush in and fill that void much to their really unjust enrichment.\\nThey have benefited so much, so sadly, for us. Our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster. No vision. No purpose. No direction. No strategy. Today I want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy.\\nFirst, our resources are totally over extended. President Obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s crippled us with wasteful spending, massive debt, low growth, a huge trade deficit and open borders. Our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching $1 trillion a year.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re rebuilding other countries while weakening our own. Ending the theft of American jobs will give us resources we need to rebuild our military, which has to happen and regain our financial independence and strength. I am the only person running for the presidency who understands this and this is a serious problem.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the only one \\xe2\\x80\\x94 believe me, I know them all, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the only one who knows how to fix it.\\nSecondly, our allies are not paying their fair share, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been talking about this recently a lot. Our allies must contribute toward their financial, political, and human costs, have to do it, of our tremendous security burden. But many of them are simply not doing so.\\nThey look at the United States as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us. In NATO, for instance, only 4 of 28 other member countries besides America, are spending the minimum required 2 percent of GDP on defense. We have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes, missiles, ships, equipment, building up our military to provide a strong defense for Europe and Asia.\\nThe countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense, and if not, the U.S. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves. We have no choice.\\nThe whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security. A Trump administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded, and funded beautifully.\\nThirdly, our friends are beginning to think they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t depend on us. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies, something that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never seen before in the history of our country. He negotiated a disastrous deal with Iran, and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the ink was dry. Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon, cannot be allowed. Remember that, cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.\\nAnd under a Trump administration, will never, ever be allowed to have that nuclear weapon.\\nAll of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the United States with Iran\\xe2\\x80\\x99s treatment of our ten captured sailors \\xe2\\x80\\x94 so vividly I remember that day. In negotiation, you must be willing to walk. The Iran deal, like so many of our worst agreements, is the result of not being willing to leave the table.\\nWhen the other side knows you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to walk, it becomes absolutely impossible to win \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you just can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win. At the same time, your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made that agreement, you have to stand by it and the world will be a better place. President Obama gutted our missile defense program and then abandoned our missile defense plans with Poland and the Czech Republic. He supported the ouster of a friendly regime in Egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with Israel, and then helped bring the Muslim Brotherhood to power in its place.\\nIsrael, our great friend and the one true democracy in the Middle East has been snubbed and criticized by an administration that lacks moral clarity. Just a few days ago, Vice President Biden again criticized Israel, a force for justice and peace, for acting as an impatient peace area in the region.\\nPresident Obama has not been a friend to Israel. He has treated Iran with tender love and care and made it a great power. Iran has, indeed, become a great, great power in just a very short period of time, because of what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done. All of the expense and all at the expense of Israel, our allies in the region and very importantly, the United States itself.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve picked fights with our oldest friends, and now they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re starting to look elsewhere for help. Remember that. Not good.\\nFourth, our rivals no longer respect us. In fact, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re just as confused as our allies, but in an even bigger problem is they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take us seriously anymore. The truth is they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t respect us. When President Obama landed in Cuba on Air Force One, no leader was there, nobody, to greet him.\\nPerhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of Air Force One. Then amazingly, the same thing happened in Saudi Arabia. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called no respect. Absolutely no respect.\\nDo you remember when the president made a long and expensive trip to Copenhagen, Denmark, to get the Olympics for our country, and after this unprecedented effort, it was announced that the United States came in fourth \\xe2\\x80\\x94 fourth place? The president of the United States making this trip \\xe2\\x80\\x94 unprecedented \\xe2\\x80\\x94 comes in fourth place. He should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment. We were laughed at all over the world, as we have been many, many times.\\nThe list of humiliations go on and on and on. President Obama watches helplessly as North Korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach. Our president has allowed China to continue its economic assault on American jobs and wealth, refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage on China necessary to rein in North Korea. We have the leverage. We have the power over China, economic power, and people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand it. And with that economic power, we can rein in and we can get them to do what they have to do with North Korea, which is totally out of control.\\nHe has even allowed China to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engaged in industrial espionage against the United States and its companies. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve let our rivals and challengers think they can get away with anything, and they do. They do at will. It always happens. If President Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s goal had been to weaken America, he could not have done a better job.\\nFinally, America no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goals. Since the end of the Cold War and the breakup of the Soviet Union, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve lacked a coherent foreign policy. One day, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re bombing Libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians. The next day, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls and absolutely falls apart. Lives lost, massive moneys lost. The world is a different place.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a humanitarian nation, but the legacy of the Obama-Clinton interventions will be weakness, confusion and disarray, a mess. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made the Middle East more unstable and chaotic than ever before. We left Christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide.\\nWe have done nothing to help the Christians, nothing, and we should always be ashamed for that, for that lack of action. Our actions in Iraq, Libya and Syria have helped unleash ISIS, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in a war against radical Islam, but President Obama won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even name the enemy, and unless you name the enemy, you will never ever solve the problem.\\nHillary Clinton also refuses to say the words radical Islam, even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country. After Secretary Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s failed intervention in Libya, Islamic terrorists in Benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave Americans. Then, instead of taking charge that night, Hillary Clinton decided to go home and sleep. Incredible.\\nClinton blames it all on a video, an excuse that was a total lie, proven to be absolutely a total lie. Our ambassador was murdered and our secretary of state misled the nation. And, by the way, she was not awake to take that call at 3 o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock in the morning. And now ISIS is making millions and millions of dollars a week selling Libya oil. And you know what? We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t blockade, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bomb, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do anything about it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s almost as if our country doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening, which could be a fact and could be true. This will all change when I become president.\\nTo our friends and allies, I say America is going to be strong again. America is going to be reliable again. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be a great and reliable ally again. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be a friend again. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon American interests and the shared interests of our allies.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting out of the nation-building business and instead focusing on creating stability in the world. Our moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water\\xe2\\x80\\x99s edge. We need a new rational American foreign policy, informed by the best minds and supported by both parties, and it will be by both parties \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Democrats, Republicans, independents, everybody, as well as by our close allies.\\nThis is how we won the Cold War and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how we will win our new future struggles, which may be many, which may be complex, but we will win if I become president.\\nFirst, we need a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical Islam. Containing the spread of radical Islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the United States and indeed the world. Events may require the use of military force, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also a philosophical struggle, like our long struggle in the Cold War.\\nIn this, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be working very closely with our allies in the Muslim world, all of which are at risk from radical Islamic violence, attacks and everything else. It is a dangerous world, more dangerous now than it has ever been.\\nWe should work \\xe2\\x80\\x94 thank you.\\nWe should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical Islam. But this has to be a two-way street. They must also be good to us. Remember that. They have to be good to us, no longer one way. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s now two-way. And remember, us and all we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing, they have to appreciate what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done to them. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to help, but they have to appreciate what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done for them. The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland. There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens and dozens more. We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies. We have no idea where these people are coming from. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no documentation. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no paperwork. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing. We have to be smart. We have to be vigilant.\\nA pause for reassessment will help us to prevent the next San Bernardino or frankly, much worse. All you have to do is look at the World Trade Center and September 11th, one of the great catastrophes, in my opinion, the single greatest military catastrophe in the history of our country; worse than Pearl Harbor because you take a look at what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happened, and citizens were attacked, as opposed to the military being attacked \\xe2\\x80\\x94 one of the true great catastrophes.\\nAnd then there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ISIS. I have a simple message for them. Their days are numbered. I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell them where and I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell them how. We must...\\n... we must as a nation be more unpredictable. We are totally predictable. We tell everything. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sending troops. We tell them. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sending something else. We have a news conference. We have to be unpredictable. And we have to be unpredictable starting now.\\nBut they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be gone. ISIS will be gone if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m elected president. And they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be gone quickly. They will be gone very, very quickly.\\nSecondly, we have to rebuild our military and our economy. The Russians and Chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability, but look at what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happened to us. Our nuclear weapons arsenal, our ultimate deterrent, has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal. And it has to happen immediately. Our active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today. The Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time. The Air Force is about one-third smaller than 1991. Pilots flying B-52s in combat missions today. These planes are older than virtually everybody in this room.\\nAnd what are we doing about this? President Obama has proposed a 2017 defense budget that in real dollars, cuts nearly 25 percent from what we were spending in 2011. Our military is depleted and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming.\\nWe will spend what we need to rebuild our military. It is the cheapest, single investment we can make. We will develop, build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind. Our military dominance must be unquestioned, and I mean unquestioned, by anybody and everybody.\\nBut we will look for savings and spend our money wisely. In this time of mounting debt, right now we have so much debt that nobody even knows how to address the problem. But I do. No one dollar can be wasted. Not one single dollar can we waste. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re also going to have to change our trade, immigration and economic policies to make our economy strong again. And to put Americans first again.\\nThis will ensure that our own workers, right here in America, get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenues, increase our economic might as a nation, make us strong financially again. So, so important. We need to think smart about areas where our technological superiority, and nobody comes close, gives us an edge.\\nThis includes 3D printing, artificial intelligence and cyber warfare. A great country also takes care of its warriors. Our commitment to them is absolute, and I mean absolute. A Trump administration will give our servicemen and women the best equipment and support in the world when they serve and where they serve. And the best care in the world when they return as veterans and they come back home to civilian life. Our veterans...\\nOur veterans have not been treated fairly or justly. These are our great people and we must treat them fairly. We must even treat them really, really well and that will happen under the Trump administration.\\nFinally, we must develop a foreign policy based on American interests. Businesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries. Look at what happened in the 1990s. Our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and this was a horrible time for us \\xe2\\x80\\x94 were attacked. and 17 brave sailors were killed on the U.S.S. Cole.\\nAnd what did we do? It seemed we put more effort into adding China into the World Trade organization, which has been a total disaster for the United States. Frankly, we spent more time on that than we did in stopping Al Qaeda. We even had an opportunity to take out Osama bin Laden and we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it\\nAnd then we got hit at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Again, the worst attack on our country in its history. Our foreign policy goals must be based on America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s core national security interests. And the following will be my priorities.\\nIn the Middle East our goals must be, and I mean must be, to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability, not radical change. We need to be clearsighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies. And believe me, we have groups that no matter what you do, they will be the enemy.: We have to be smart enough to recognize who those groups are, who those people are, and not help them. And we must only be generous to those that prove they are indeed our friends.\\nWe desire to live peacefully and in friendship with Russia and China. We have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes, but we are not bound to be adversaries. We should seek common ground based on shared interests.\\nRussia, for instance, has also seen the horror of Islamic terrorism. I believe an easing of tensions, and improved relations with Russia from a position of strength only is possible, absolutely possible. Common sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility must end and ideally will end soon. Good for both countries.\\nSome say the Russians won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be reasonable. I intend to find out. If we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make a deal under my administration, a deal that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not good, great \\xe2\\x80\\x94 for America, but also good for Russia, then we will quickly walk from the table. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s as simple as that. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to find out.\\nFixing our relations with China is another important step \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and really toward creating an even more prosperous period of time. China respects strength and by letting them take advantage of us economically, which they are doing like never before, we have lost all of their respect.\\nWe have a massive trade deficit with China, a deficit that we have to find a way quickly, and I mean quickly, to balance. A strong and smart America is an America that will find a better friend in China, better than we have right now. Look at what China is doing in the South China Sea. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not supposed to be doing it.\\nNo respect for this country or this president. We can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways. If need be, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to have to happen.\\nAfter I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m elected president, I will also call for a summit with our NATO allies and a separate summit with our Asian allies. In these summits, we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments, but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges. For instance, we will discuss how we can upgrade NATO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s outdated mission and structure, grown out of the Cold War to confront our shared challenges, including migration and Islamic terrorism.\\nI will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative. But if America fights, it must only fight to win.\\nI will never sent our finest into battle unless necessary, and I mean absolutely necessary, and will only do so if we have a plan for victory with a capital V.\\nOur goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction. The best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy. With President Obama and Secretary Clinton we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had the exact opposite \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy, one that has blazed the path of destruction in its wake.\\nAfter losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars, we are in far worst shape in the Middle East than ever, ever before. I challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of Obama/Clinton. It has been a complete and total disaster.\\nI will also be prepared to deploy America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economic resources. Financial leverage and sanctions can be very, very persuasive, but we need to use them selectively and with total determination. Our power will be used if others do not play by the rules. In other words, if they do not treat us fairly. Our friends and enemies must know that if I draw a line in the sand, I will enforce that line in the sand. Believe me.\\nHowever, unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct. You cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy. A superpower understands that caution and restraint are really truly signs of strength. Although not in government service, I was totally against the war in Iraq, very proudly, saying for many years that it would destabilize the Middle East. Sadly, I was correct, and the biggest beneficiary has been has been Iran, who is systematically taking over Iraq and gaining access to their very rich oil reserves, something it has wanted to do for decades.\\nAnd now, to top it off, we have ISIS. My goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why I also look and have to look for talented experts with approaches and practical ideas, rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect r\\xc3\\xa9sum\\xc3\\xa9s but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war. We have to look to new people.\\nWe have to look to new people because many of the old people frankly don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing, even though they may look awfully good writing in The New York Times or being watched on television.\\nFinally, I will work with our allies to reinvigorate Western values and institutions. Instead of trying to spread universal values that not everybody shares or wants, we should understand that strengthening and promoting Western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions.\\nThese are my goals as president. I will seek a foreign policy that all Americans, whatever their party, can support, so important, and which our friends and allies will respect and totally welcome. The world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we want. We want them to be our allies.\\nWe want the world to be \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we want to bring peace to the world. Too much destruction out there, too many destructive weapons. The power of weaponry is the single biggest problem that we have today in the world.\\nTo achieve these goals, Americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership. Again, many Americans must wonder why we our politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than in defending their own. Americans.\\nAmericans must know that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re putting the American people first again on trade.\\nSo true. On trade, on immigration, on foreign policy. The jobs, incomes and security of the American worker will always be my first priority.\\nNo country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first. Both our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours and we, while being fair to them, must start doing the same. We will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism. The nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony. I am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring America down and will never enter.\\nAnd under my administration, we will never enter America into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs.\\nNAFTA, as an example, has been a total disaster for the United States and has emptied our states \\xe2\\x80\\x94 literally emptied our states of our manufacturing and our jobs. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve just gotten to see it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve toured Pennsylvania. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve toured New York. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve toured so many of the states. They have been cleaned out. Their manufacturing is gone.\\nNever again, only the reverse \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and I have to say this strongly \\xe2\\x80\\x94 never again; only the reverse will happen. We will keep our jobs and bring in new ones. There will be consequences for the companies that leave the United States only to exploit it later. They fire the people. They take advantage of the United States. There will be consequences for those companies. Never again.\\nUnder a Trump administration, no American citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of a foreign country.\\nI will view as president the world through the clear lens of American interests. I will be America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s greatest defender and most loyal champion. We will not apologize for becoming successful again, but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we are.\\nThe world is most peaceful and most prosperous when America is strongest. America will continue and continue forever to play the role of peacemaker. We will always help save lives and indeed humanity itself, but to play the role, we must make America strong again.\\nAnd always \\xe2\\x80\\x94 always, always, we must make, and we have to look at it from every angle, and we have no choice, we must make America respected again. We must make America truly wealthy again. And we must \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we have to and we will make America great again. And if we do that \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and if we do that, perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever, ever known. Thank you very much, everybody. I appreciate it. Thank you.\\n\\nA hand with little fingers coming out of a stem. Like, little. Look at my hands. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re fine. Nobody other than Graydon Carter years ago used to use that. My hands are normal hands. During a debate, he was losing, and he said, \"Oh, he has small hands and therefore, you know what that means.\" This was not me. This was Rubio that said, \"He has small hands and you know what that means.\" Okay? So, he started it. So, what I said a couple of days later ... and what happened is I was on line shaking hands with supporters, and one of supporters got up and he said, \"Mr. Trump, you have strong hands. You have good-sized hands.\" And then another one would say, \"You have great hands, Mr. Trump, I had no idea.\" I said, \"What do you mean?\" He said, \"I thought you were like deformed, and I thought you had small hands.\" I had fifty people ... Is that a correct statement? I mean people were writing, \"How are Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hands?\" My hands are fine. You know, my hands are normal. Slightly large, actually. In fact, I buy a slightly smaller than large glove, okay? No, but I did this because everybody was saying to me, \"Oh, your hands are very nice. They are normal.\" So Rubio, in a debate, said, because he had nothing else to say ... now I was hitting him pretty hard. He wanted to do his Don Rickles stuff and it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work out. Obviously, it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work too well. But one of the things he said was \"He has small hands and therefore, you know what that means, he has small something else.\" You can look it up. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say it.\\n I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want people to go around thinking that I have a problem. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m telling you, Ruth, I had so many people. I would say 25, 30 people would tell me ... every time I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d shake people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hand, \"Oh, you have nice hands.\" Why shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t I? And, by the way, by saying that I solved the problem. Nobody questions ... I even held up my hands, and said, \"Look, take a look at that hand.\"\\n  I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if it was presidential, honestly, whether it is or not. He said, \\xe2\\x80\\x98Donald Trump has small hands and therefore he has small something else.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say that. And all I did is when he failed, when he was failing, when he was, when Christie made him look bad, I gave him the\\xe2\\x80\\x93 a little recap and I said, and I said, and I had this big strong powerful hand ready to grab him, because I thought he was going to faint. And everybody took it fine. Whether it was presidential or not I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell you. I can just say that what he said was a lie. And everybody, they wanted to do stories on my hands; after I said that, they never did. And then I held up the hand, I showed people the hand. You know, when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a big audience. So yeah, I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a question of presidential ...\\n\\nOh boy. We love Nevada. We love Nevada. Thank you. Thank you. Oh this is a great place. Thank you very much. Great evening. We will be celebrating for a long time tonight. Have a good time. Have a good time.\\nYou know we weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expecting\\xe2\\x80\\x94a couple of months ago, we weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expecting to win this one, you know that, right? We weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Of course if you listen to the pundits, we weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expected to win too much, and now we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re winning, winning, winning the country. And soon the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to start winning, winning, winning. So I want to thank the volunteers. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been unbelievable. These people, they work like endlessly, endlessly. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to forget it. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had some great numbers coming out of Texas, and amazing numbers coming out of Tennessee and Georgia and Arkansas and then in a couple of weeks later Florida. We love Florida so. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do very well in Ohio. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re beating the governor. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always nice to be beating the governor. And Michigan\\xe2\\x80\\x94the whole thing. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be an amazing two months.\\nWe might not even need the two months, folks, to be honest. So tonight we had 45 to 46%, and tomorrow you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d hear them say, you know, if they could just take the other candidates and add them up, and if you could add them up because you know the other candidates amount to 55%. So if they could\\xe2\\x80\\x94they keep forgetting that when people drop out, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get a lot of votes. You know they keep forgetting.\\nSo I want to begin by thanking my boys, Eric has been all over the place making speeches. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s getting better than me so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a little jealous. And Don went to _____, you were all over, right?\\nHe loves the rifle stuff. This is serious rifle. This is serious NRA, both of them, both of them. We love the Second Amendment folks. Nobody loves it more than us, so just remember that.\\nAnd Corey and Hope, the staff, the whole group, and Charles and Dan and what a group we have. I want to just thank a couple of friends of mine that are here, the owner of this incredible hotel, Mr. and Mrs. Phil Ruffin, stand up. Great guy. Phil said, \"Donald,\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94like for the last three months he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s driving me crazy, he said\\xe2\\x80\\x94\"Donald, I want to put $10 million into your campaign.\" I said, \"Phil I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want your money. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to do it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m self funding.\" Every time I see him. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard for me to turn down money because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done in my whole life. I grab and grab and grab. You know I get greedy. I want money, money.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do, right? We get greedy, right? Now we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get greedy for the United States. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to grab and grab and grab. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to bring in so much money and so much everything. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make America great again, folks, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m telling you folks, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make America great again.\\nAnd another great friend of mine, someone respected by everybody, a great friend of Phil too\\xe2\\x80\\x94Mr. and Mrs. Steve Wynn. Stand up, Steve. Stand up. Two great people. Steve is always calling. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always got advice, right Steve? \"Donald I think you should do this and that.\" His advice I like to listen to, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be honest. So Phil and Steve and families, we appreciate it. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been great friends. Thank you, thank you.\\nSo this was very exciting tonight. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you it looks like we won by a lot evangelicals. I love evangelicals, and I have to tell you pastor [Robert] Jeffress has been so incredible on television and elsewhere. He has been great. And as you know Liberty University\\xe2\\x80\\x94do we love Liberty University? Huh? Jerry Falwell Jr., an unbelievable guy, and he has been with us and with us from the beginning, and I want to thank Jerry and his family. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been amazing, the relationship. So we won the evangelicals.\\nWe won with young. We won with old. We won with highly educated. We won with poorly educated. I love the poorly educated. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the smartest people, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the most loyal people, and you know what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m happy about? Because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been saying it for a long time. 46% were the Hispanics\\xe2\\x80\\x9446%, No. 1 one with Hispanics. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m really happy about that.\\nSo I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very proud of you, this is an amazing night. I love the country, I love the country. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going in the wrong direction. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to keep\\xe2\\x80\\x94as you know Gitmo, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re keeping that open, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to load it up with bad dudes. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to load it up w a lot of bad dudes out there. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have our borders nice and strong. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to build the wall, you know that. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to build the wall. And I have a lot of respect from Mexico, and you just heard we won Hispanics. But let me tell you Mexico is going to pay for the wall, right? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to happen. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to happen. They know it. I know it. We all know it.\\nWe have a tremendous deficit. We have a trade deficit with Mexico. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll pay for the wall. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be very happy about it. Believe me. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll talk to them. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be very, very thrilled. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be thrilled to be paying for the wall.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be the smart people. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to be the people that get pushed around all over the place. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be the smart people. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be proud of your president, and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be even prouder of your country, OK?\\nSo tonight folks, this was a great evening. I love this place. I love this state. I love Las Vegas. I have spent and invested so much money over here. Trump International Hotel\\xe2\\x80\\x94I keep telling Steve we have the best hotel in Las Vegas. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fighting me all the time. But that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s OK. But I just want to say it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great state, and they have great people. And I was so proud. You know, I went to caucus. I was all over the place tonight. The people are amazing. The enthusiasm, it was unbelievable to see.\\nThe people of this country are absolutely amazing. I love you folks very much. Remember: Make America great again. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do it, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to happen fast. Thank you very much everybody. We love you. We love you.\\n  \\nWow. Whoa. That is some group of people. Thousands.\\nSo nice, thank you very much. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really nice. Thank you. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great to be at Trump Tower. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great to be in a wonderful city, New York. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an honor to have everybody here. This is beyond anybody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expectations. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been no crowd like this.\\nAnd, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know the air-conditioner didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work. They sweated like dogs.\\nThey didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know the room was too big, because they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have anybody there. How are they going to beat ISIS? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gonna happen.\\nOur country is in serious trouble. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have victories anymore. We used to have victories, but we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have them. When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time.\\nWhen did we beat Japan at anything? They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do? When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exist, folks. They beat us all the time.\\nWhen do we beat Mexico at the border? They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re killing us economically.\\nThe U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else\\xe2\\x80\\x99s problems.\\n  \\nThank you. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not sending their best. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not sending you. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not sending you. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re bringing those problems with us. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re bringing drugs. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re bringing crime. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.\\noh And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sending us not the right people.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming from more than Mexico. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming from all over South and Latin America, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming probably \\xe2\\x80\\x94 probably \\xe2\\x80\\x94 from the Middle East. But we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to stop and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to stop fast.\\nIslamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve become rich. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in competition with them.\\nThey just built a hotel in Syria. Can you believe this? They built a hotel. When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve taken.\\nSo now ISIS has the oil, and what they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have, Iran has. And in 19 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever had, and we need it more now than ever. But I said, \"Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hit Iraq,\" because you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to totally destabilize the Middle East. Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq. Think of it. Iran is taking over Iraq, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re taking it over big league.\\nWe spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion. We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq. We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re great \\xe2\\x80\\x94 all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers.\\nAnd we have nothing. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even go there. We have nothing. And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.\\nLast week, I read 2,300 Humvees \\xe2\\x80\\x94 these are big vehicles \\xe2\\x80\\x94 were left behind for the enemy. 2,000? You would say maybe two, maybe four? 2,300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them.\\nLast quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a sign of strength, right? But not for us. It was below zero. Whoever heard of this? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s never below zero.\\nOur labor participation rate was the worst since 1978. But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate.\\nAnd our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe the 5.6. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it.\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right. A lot of people up there can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get jobs. They can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs. They all have jobs.\\nBut the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a statistic that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s full of nonsense.\\nOur enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker. Even our nuclear arsenal doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work.\\nIt came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if it worked. And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, \"That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing.\"\\nWe have a disaster called the big lie: Obamacare. Obamacare.\\nYesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof. You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s virtually useless. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s virtually useless. It is a disaster.TRUMP: And remember the $5 billion Web site? $5 billion we spent on a Web site, and to this day it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work. A $5 billion Web site.\\nIf and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been President because this would not have happened. ISIS would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now with our all talk, no action politicians.\\nThe Mexican government and its leadership has made many disparaging remarks about me to the Pope, because they want to continue to rip off the United States, both on trade and at the border, and they understand I am totally wise to them. The Pope only heard one side of the story - he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see the crime, the drug trafficking and the negative economic impact the current policies have on the United States. He doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see how Mexican leadership is outsmarting President Obama and our leadership in every aspect of negotiation.\\nFor a religious leader to question a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s faith is disgraceful. I am proud to be a Christian and as President I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened, unlike what is happening now, with our current President. No leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s religion or faith. They are using the Pope as a pawn and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so, especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant.\\nI have so many Web sites, I have them all over the place. I hire people, they do a Web site. It costs me $3. $5 billion Web site.\\nWell, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action. Nothing\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gonna get done. They will not bring us \\xe2\\x80\\x94 believe me \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to the promised land. They will not.\\nAs an example, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans. And they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re wonderful people. I like them. They all want me to support them. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how to bring it about. They come up to my office. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m meeting with three of them in the next week. And they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \"Are you running? Are you not running? Could we have your support? What do we do? How do we do it?\"\\nI like them. And I hear their speeches. And they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk jobs and they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk China. When was the last time you heard China is killing us? They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe. It makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re killing us.\\nBut you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hear that from anybody else. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hear it from anybody else. And I watch the speeches.\\nThank you.\\nI watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen. And people are saying, \"What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on? I just want a job. Just get me a job. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need the rhetoric. I want a job.\"\\nAnd that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in \\xe2\\x80\\x9916, 2016. Obama is going to be out playing golf. He might be on one of my courses. I would invite him, I actually would say. I have the best courses in the world, so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d say, you what, if he wants to \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac. If he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to play, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fine.\\nIn fact, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.\\nBut Obamacare kicks in in 2016. Really big league. It is going to be amazingly destructive. Doctors are quitting. I have a friend who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a doctor, and he said to me the other day, \"Donald, I never saw anything like it. I have more accountants than I have nurses. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a disaster. My patients are beside themselves. They had a plan that was good. They have no plan now.\"\\nWe have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody. Let it be for everybody. But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government. And we can do it.\\nSo I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve watched the politicians. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve dealt with them all my life. If you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make a good deal with a politician, then there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something wrong with you. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re certainly not very good. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we have= representing us. They will never make America great again. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even have a chance. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re controlled fully \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.\\nYes, they control them. Hey, I have lobbyists. I have to tell you. I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re great. But you know what? it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen. It won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen. Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s destroying our country. We have to stop, and it has to stop now.\\nWe need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets. Our vets have been abandoned.\\nAnd we also need a cheerleader.\\nYou know, when President Obama was elected, I said, \"Well, the one thing, I think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do well. I think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be a great cheerleader for the country. I think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be a great spirit.\"\\nHe was vibrant. He was young. I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.\\nHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a leader. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re right about that.\\nBut he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a cheerleader. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actually a negative force. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been a negative force. He wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a cheerleader; he was the opposite.\\nWe need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not great again.\\nWe need \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we need somebody \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again. We can do that.\\nAnd, I will tell you, I love my life. I have a wonderful family. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re saying, \"Dad, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do something that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be so tough.\"\\nYou know, all of my life, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office. Just can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen. And yet that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.\\nSo ladies and gentlemen...\\nI am officially running...\\n... for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again.\\nIt can happen. Our country has tremendous potential. We have tremendous people.\\nWe have people that aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t working. We have people that have no incentive to work. But they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job. And they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be proud, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll love it, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll make much more than they would\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever made, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be doing so well, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be thriving as a country, thriving. It can happen.\\nI will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. I tell you that.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll bring back our jobs, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll bring back our money.\\nRight now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion. We owe Japan more than that. So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s even better.\\nHow stupid are our leaders? How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen? How stupid are they?\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to tell you \\xe2\\x80\\x94 thank you. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons.\\nNumber one, the people negotiating don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a clue. Our president doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a clue. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bad negotiator.\\nHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the one that did Bergdahl. We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.\\nWe get Bergdahl. We get a traitor. We get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the negotiator we have.\\nTake a look at the deal he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s making with Iran. He makes that deal, Israel maybe won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exist very long. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a disaster, and we have to protect Israel. But...\\nSo we need people \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a free trader. But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you. If you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have talented people, if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have great leadership, if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.\\nFree trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid. We have people that aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t smart. And we have people that are controlled by special interests. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just not going to work.\\nSo, here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a couple of stories happened recently. A friend of mine is a great manufacturer. And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it. I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.\\nBut with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything \\xe2\\x80\\x94 everything, they got away with it again. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impossible for our people here to compete.\\nSo I want to tell you this story. A friend of mine who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very upset. I said, \"What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s your problem?\"\\nHe said, \"You know, I make great product.\"\\nAnd I said, \"I know. I know that because I buy the product.\"\\nHe said, \"I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get it into China. They won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t accept it. I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back. They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it.\"\\nI said, \"Oh, wait a minute, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s terrible. Does anyone know this?\"\\nHe said, \"Yeah, they do it all the time with other people.\"\\nI said, \"They send it back?\"\\n\"Yeah. So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not supposed to be doing that. I told them.\"\\nNow, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.\\nAsk Boeing. They wanted Boeing\\xe2\\x80\\x99s secrets. They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing.\\nHey, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not saying they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re stupid. I like China. I sell apartments for \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China. Am I supposed to dislike them? I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war. Very valuable.\\nI love China. The biggest bank in the world is from China. You know where their United States headquarters is located? In this building, in Trump Tower. I love China. People say, \"Oh, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like China?\"\\nNo, I love them. But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sustain ourself with that. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too much \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the difference between China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leaders and our leaders.\\nThey are ripping us. We are rebuilding China. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re rebuilding many countries. China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it. They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes. And they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all over the place.\\nWe have all the cards, but we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how to use them. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand the game. We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.\\nNow they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going militarily. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re building a military island in the middle of the South China sea. A military island. Now, our country could never do that because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let our country \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we would never build in an ocean. They built it in about one year, this massive military port.\\nThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re building up their military to a point that is very scary. You have a problem with ISIS. You have a bigger problem with China.\\nAnd, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico.\\nSo this man tells me about the manufacturing. I say, \"That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a terrible story. I hate to hear it.\"\\nBut I have another one, Ford.\\nSo Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out. Everybody thought the deal was dead. Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently. Everybody thought it was a done deal. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going in and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be it, going into Tennessee. Great state, great people.TRUMP: All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to Tennessee. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead. Not good.\\nNow, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico. $2.5 billion, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be one of the largest in the world. Ford. Good company.\\nSo I announced that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m running for president. I would...\\n... one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even use \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you know, I have \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I know the smartest negotiators in the world. I know the good ones. I know the bad ones. I know the overrated ones.\\nYou get a lot of them that are overrated. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not good. They think they are. They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph). But they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not good.\\nBut I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country. Believe me, folks. We will do very, very well, very, very well.\\nBut I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even waste my time with this one. I would call up the head of Ford, who I know. If I was president, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d say, \"Congratulations. I understand that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border.\"\\nAnd you say to yourself, \"How does that help us,\" right? \"How does that help us? Where is that good\"? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not.\\nSo I would say, \"Congratulations. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the good news. Let me give you the bad news. Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s it.\\nNow, here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what is going to happen. If it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not me in the position, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of these politicians that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re running against, you know, the 400 people that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re (inaudible). And here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to happen. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not so stupid. They know it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it. But then they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, \"You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that to Ford.\"\\nAnd guess what? No problem. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to build in Mexico. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take away thousands of jobs. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very bad for us.\\nSo under President Trump, here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what would happen:\\nThe head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news. But it could be he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d want to be cool, and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll wait until the next day. You know, they want to be a little cool.\\nAnd he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say, \"Please, please, please.\" He\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll beg for a little while, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say, \"No interest.\" Then he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll call all sorts of political people, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say, \"Sorry, fellas. No interest,\" because I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need anybody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s money. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nice. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need anybody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s money.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m using my own money. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not using the lobbyists. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not using donors. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m really rich. I (inaudible).\\nAnd by the way, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not even saying that in a \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the kind of mindset, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the kind of thinking you need for this country.\\nSo \\xe2\\x80\\x94 because we got to make the country rich.\\nIt sounds crass. Somebody said, \"Oh, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s crass.\" It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not crass.\\nWe got $18 trillion in debt. We got nothing but problems.\\nWe got a military that needs equipment all over the place. We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got nothing. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got Social Security that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bring money into the country. All these other people want to cut the hell out of it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to cut it at all; I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to bring money in, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to save it.\\nBut here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to happen:\\nAfter I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m called by all of the special interests and by the \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the donors and by the lobbyists \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get a call the next day from the head of Ford. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say. \"Please reconsider,\" I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say no.\\nHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say, \"Mr. President, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve decided to move the plant back to the United States, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to build it in Mexico.\" That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s it. They have no choice. They have no choice.\\nThere are hundreds of things like that. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll give you another example.TRUMP: Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day. $1 billion a day. I love the Saudis. Many are in this building. They make a billion dollars a day. Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships. We say \"we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re gonna protect.\" What are we doing? They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got nothing but money.\\nIf the right person asked them, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d pay a fortune. They wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be there except for us.\\nAnd believe me, you look at the border with Yemen. You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory. Two weeks later, the place was blown up. Everybody got out \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and they kept our equipment.\\nThey always keep our equipment. We ought to send used equipment, right? They always keep our equipment. We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we ought to send our surplus. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.\\nBut look at that border with Saudi Arabia. Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen? Saudi Arabia without us is gone. They;re gone.\\nAnd I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq. You know, all of these politicians that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m running against now \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so nice to say I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m running as opposed to if I run, if I run. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m running.\\nBut all of these politicians that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m running against now, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re trying to disassociate. I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq. He couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t answer the question. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. I said, \"Is he intelligent?\"\\nThen I looked at Rubio. He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing? He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. He couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t answer the question.\\nHow are these people gonna lead us? How are we gonna \\xe2\\x80\\x94 how are we gonna go back and make it great again? We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a clue. They can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t lead us. They can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. They can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even answer simple questions. It was terrible.\\nBut Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble. Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place. And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders. They were smarter than our leaders.\\nThere is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again. Because we need money. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re dying. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re dying. We need money. We have to do it. And we need the right people.\\nSo Ford will come back. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll all come back. And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s based on competence.\\nSo the reporter said to me the other day, \"But, Mr. Trump, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not a nice person. How can you get people to vote for you?\"\\nI said, \"I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know.\" I said, \"I think that number one, I am a nice person. I give a lot of money away to charities and other things. I think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m actually a very nice person.\"\\nBut, I said, \"This is going to be an election that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people. And they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world. And they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education. And some of them are like third world countries. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything. So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do it. Because a lot of people said, \"He\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never run. Number one, he won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to give up his lifestyle.\"\\nThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re right about that, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing it.\\nNumber two, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a private company, so nobody knows what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m worth. And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.\\nSo I said, \"That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s OK.\" I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m proud of my net worth. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done an amazing job.\\nI started off \\xe2\\x80\\x94 thank you \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and I love my father. I learned so much. He was a great negotiator. I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors. But I learned a lot.\\nBut he used to say, \"Donald, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go into Manhattan. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the big leagues. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know anything about that. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it.\"\\nI said, \"I gotta go into Manhattan. I gotta build those big buildings. I gotta do it, Dad. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gotta do it.\"\\nAnd after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the Grand Hyatt Hotel. I was responsible for the convention center on the west side. I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young. And now I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m building all over the world, and I love what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing.\\nBut they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, \"Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s private and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably not as successful as everybody thinks.\"\\nSo I said to myself, you know, nobody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ever going to know unless I run, because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m really proud of my success. I really am.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve employed \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. That means medical. That means education. That means everything.\\nSo a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s big and complex, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary. But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t extensions or anything. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be filing it right on time. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need anything.\\nAnd it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, \"He had assets of $9 billion.\" So I said (ph), \"No, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the wrong number. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the wrong number. Not assets.\"\\nSo they put together this. And before I say it, I have to say this. I made it the old-fashioned way. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s real estate. You know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s real estate.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s labor, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t in unions, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all over the place and building all over the world.\\nAnd I have assets \\xe2\\x80\\x94 big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected \\xe2\\x80\\x94 9 billion 240 million dollars.\\nAnd I have liabilities of about $500 million (ph). That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s long-term debt, very low interest rates.\\nIn fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, \"Donald, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have enough borrowings. Could we loan you $4 billion\"? I said, \"I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need it. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want it. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been there. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want it.\"\\nBut in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted. So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be well-over $10 billion. But here, a total net worth of \\xe2\\x80\\x94 net worth, not assets, not \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to as the Trump building right opposite the New York \\xe2\\x80\\x94 many other places all over the world.\\nSo the total is $8,737,540,00.\\nNow I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not doing that...\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not doing that to brag, because you know what? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to brag. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to, believe it or not.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing that to say that that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the kind of thinking our country needs. We need that thinking. We have the opposite thinking.\\nWe have losers. We have losers. We have people that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have it. We have people that are morally corrupt. We have people that are selling this country down the drain.\\nSo I put together this statement, and the only reason I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you know, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re at $8 trillion now. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re soon going to be at $20 trillion.TRUMP: According to the economists \\xe2\\x80\\x94 who I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re saying \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that $24 trillion \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re very close \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the point of no return. $24 trillion. We will be there soon. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s when we become Greece. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s when we become a country that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unsalvageable. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re gonna be there very soon. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re gonna be there very soon.\\nI will immediately terminate President Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s illegal executive order on immigration, immediately.\\nFully support and back up the Second Amendment.\\nNow, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very interesting. Today I heard it. Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are. And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, \"You know, Mr. Trump,\" and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, \"You know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want guns. And now since this happened\" \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s up in the prison area \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \"my husband and I are finally in agreement, because he wanted the guns. We now have a gun on every table. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re ready to start shooting.\"\\nI said, \"Very interesting.\"\\nSo protect the Second Amendment.\\nEnd \\xe2\\x80\\x94 end Common Core. Common Core should \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it is a disaster. Bush is totally in favor of Common Core. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see how he can possibly get the nomination. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s weak on immigration. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in favor of Common Core. How the hell can you vote for this guy? You just can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it. We have to end \\xe2\\x80\\x94 education has to be local.\\nRebuild the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s infrastructure.\\nNobody can do that like me. Believe me. It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.\\nI look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one-third. What they do is unbelievable, how bad.\\nYou know, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re converting it into one of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great hotels. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gonna be the best hotel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington. The Obama administration. We got it. It was the most highly sought after \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services. We got it. People were shocked, Trump got it.\\nWell, I got it for two reasons. Number one, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re really good. Number two, we had a really good plan. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll add in the third, we had a great financial statement. Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job. And they wanted to make sure it got built.\\nSo we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports. You come into La Guardia Airport, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in a third world country. You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor. They throw down asphalt, and they throw.\\nYou look at these airports, we are like a third world country. And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world. You come to back to this country and you have LAX, disaster. You have all of these disastrous airports. We have to rebuild our infrastructure.\\nSave Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts. Have to do it.\\nGet rid of the fraud. Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it. People have been paying it for years. And now many of these candidates want to cut it. You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being lost.\\nRenegotiate our foreign trade deals.\\nReduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in a bubble. We have artificially low interest rates. We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening. We have a stock market that is so bloated.\\nBe careful of a bubble because what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens. So be very, very careful.\\nAnd strengthen our military and take care of our vets. So, so important.\\n  \\nChris, thank you very much. I appreciate it.\\nThis has been an amazing evening. Already, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve won five major states and it looks like we could win six or seven or eight or nine.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really been \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really been great.\\nI want to congratulation Ted on the winning of Texas. He worked hard on he \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I know how hard he worked actually, and so I congratulate Ted Cruz on that win. That was an excellent win.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make America great again, folks. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make it great again.\\nAnd, you know, I watched Hillary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech and she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talking about wages have been poor and everything\\xe2\\x80\\x99s poor and everything\\xe2\\x80\\x99s doing badly, but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been there for so long. I mean, if she hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t straightened it out by now, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to straighten it out in the next four years. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just going to become worse and worse. She wants to make America whole again and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m trying to figure out what is that all about. Make America great again is going to be much better than making America whole again.\\nSo I just want to say that this was an exciting evening. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so great to be in Florida. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so great to be at Mar-A-Lago with friends and the press and the media and everybody.\\nI know it was a very tough night for Marco Rubio. He had a tough night but he worked hard. He spent a lot of money. He is a lightweight, as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve said many times before. But you know what? We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to go to Florida, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to spend so much time in Florida. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got about a 20-point lead. I know that a lot of groups, a lot of the special interests and a lot of the lobbyists and the people that want to have their little senator do exactly as they want, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to put $20 million or $25 million into it over the next two weeks, from what just came over the wires. And frankly, I think that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fine. As far as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m concerned, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fine. And if he wins, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have totally controlled \\xe2\\x80\\x94 total control. But he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going anywhere anyway, but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see what happens. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to spend a lot of time in Florida.\\nThe Virginia one was just a great win because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a place that is just spectacular and a place that we have big investments in, as we have in Florida. Remember, we have thousands of employees in Florida, all along Miami, Doral and Mar-A-Lago and so many other places. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been an amazing place to invest. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been amazing to have so many wonderful employees, so many of whom are here tonight, really urging us on.\\nAnd you know, I have thousands of employees all over the country, actually, all over the world but for purposes of tonight, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll just say all over the country. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been just so beautiful to watch this company grow and to watch it grow so strongly.\\nRecent articles came out talking about how great a company we built, and now we want to put that same ability into doing something for our nation. I mean, our nation is in serious trouble. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re being chilled on trade, absolutely destroyed. China is just taking advantage of us. I have nothing against China. I have great respect for China, but their leaders are too smart for our leaders. Our leaders don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a clue and the trade deficits at $400 billion and $500 are too much. No country can sustain that kind of trade deficit. It won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be that way for long. We have the greatest business leaders in the world on my team already and, believe me, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to redo those trade deals and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be a thing of beauty.\\nYou look at countries like Mexico, where they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re killing us on the border, absolutely destroying us on the border. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re destroying us in terms of economic development. Companies like Carrier Air Conditioner just moving into Mexico. Ford, moving into Mexico. Nabisco, closing up shop in Chicago and moving into Mexico. We have to stop it, folks. I know how to stop it. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to create jobs. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to create jobs like you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never seen.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to lower taxes. I have a plan that Larry Kudlow and so many others think is the best plan they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to lower taxes substantially for the middle class. The middle class has been forgotten in our country. It really helped and really probably was the predominant factor in making our country into a country that we all love so much and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all so proud of, but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve forgotten the middle class. So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to lower taxes.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re lowering taxes on business. You look at all the companies that are moving out. When you see Pfizer moving to Ireland and you see so many other companies, constantly now they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leaving. They used to move from New York to Florida, or they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d move from New Jersey to someplace else, Chris. But now they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re moving from here \\xe2\\x80\\x94  \\xe2\\x80\\x94 not that many people are leaving New Jersey. But Chris understands the problem, fully understands. Now they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leaving from places that they used to move to into other parts of the world. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let that happen.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve lost our manufacturing jobs. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve lost our manufacturing. Millions and millions of jobs, thousands and thousands and thousands of plants, manufacturing plants, warehouses. I mean, we are losing so much. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let it happen.\\nI tell the story often about a friend of mine who is in the excavation business and he always orders Caterpillar. And recently, he ordered Komatsu tractors from Japan because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve cut the yen. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve devalued the yen to such an extent that it was virtually impossible for Caterpillar to compete. And I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want that to happen. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen. They shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be allowed to do it.\\nWe have tremendous power over everybody because we are really the source. We have great, great power. The problem is we have politicians who truly, truly, truly don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing. So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to work very, very hard.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m so honored by this evening. If you would\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve told me on June 16th, when I was with my wife, Melania, and we came down the escalator in Trump Tower and it looked, literally, well, a little bit like this. You have a lot of cameras here tonight.\\nIt looked, literally, like the Academy Awards. I never saw so many cameras in my life. And it takes courage to run. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what, it takes a lot of courage to run for president. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never done this before. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been a job-producer. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done a lot of things but this is something I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never done, but I felt we had to do it. When you look at the incompetence of the Iran deal, where we give $150 billion, we get absolutely nothing. When you look at all of the problems our country has and you look at our military, which is really being depleted rapidly, depleted. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make our military bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and nobody, nobody, nobody is going to mess with us, folks, nobody.\\nSo it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just an amazing honor to have you with me tonight. And if you want, press, I think we told you before we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be okay if you want to ask a few questions.\\nYes, go ahead.\\nWell, they can always do that and then they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll \\xe2\\x80\\x94 then they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll just lose everything and that would be the \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that would be the work of a loser.\\nBut let me just explain something. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happened, whether you go to South Carolina, where I had a huge victory, where we had a tremendous victory in New Hampshire, tremendous in Nevada, you look at what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happened, and tonight, of course, is the best of all. I mean, right now, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re projected I guess six, but we could be seven, eight, nine, and major states. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Georgia, Alabama, Massachusetts \\xe2\\x80\\x94 (CHEERS) \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Tennessee, Virginia. And you know, these are amazing states and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to probably get a lot more. In fact, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re projected to have some pretty good additional numbers.\\nBut I will say this. Look, we have expanded the Republican Party. When you look at what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happened in South Carolina and you see the kind of numbers that we got, in terms of extra people coming in. They came from the Democratic Party, or the Democrat Party, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re Democrats and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re long-time Democrats and they were never going to switch and they all switched. And they were independents. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve actually expanded the party. Look at the number of votes we had in that area, as an example. Four years ago, they had 390,000 or so votes. We doubled it. We were almost 800,000. Whereas the Democrats went down. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s much less enthusiasm for the Democrats.\\nSo I \\xe2\\x80\\x94 look, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a unifier. I know people are going to find that a little bit hard to believe, but believe me, I am a unifier. Once we get all of this finished, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to go after one person, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Hillary Clinton, on the assumption she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s allowed to run, which is a big assumption. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be allowed to run. And I think that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, frankly, going to be an easy race. You see the polls. I beat Hillary in many polls. I know one thing. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think Marco is going to be able to beat her. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in all fairness, I think Ted\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to have a very hard time. But Ted at least has a shot because at least he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s won a little bit.\\nSo I just tell you this. We are going to be a much finer party, a much \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be a unified party, I mean, to be honest with you. And we are going to be a much bigger party, and you can see that happening. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be a much bigger party. Our party is expanding. And all you have to do it take a look at the primary states where I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve won and just look \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gone from X number to a much larger number. That hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happened to the Republican Party in many, many decades. So I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be more inclusive. I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be more unified and I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be a much bigger party, and I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win in November. OK, yeah?\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m just doing what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right. Look, Planned Parenthood has done very good work for some \\xe2\\x80\\x94 for many, many \\xe2\\x80\\x94 for millions of women. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say it and I know a lot of the so-called conservatives, they say that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really \\xe2\\x80\\x94 because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a conservative, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a common-sense conservative. But millions of women have been helped by Planned Parenthood. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to allow and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to fund as long as you have the abortion going on at Planned Parenthood, and we understand that and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve said it loud and clear. But \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see what happens. But Planned Parenthood \\xe2\\x80\\x94 millions of people \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had thousands of letters from women that have been helped. And this wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a setup. This was people writing letters. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to be really good for women. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to be good for women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s health issues. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very important to me, very important to me.\\n And maybe that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a perfect conservative view, but I can tell you one thing. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m more conservative than anybody on the military, on taking care of our vets, on the border, on the wall, on getting rid of Obamacare and coming up with something much, much better, and certainly, getting rid of common core and bringing education to a local level so that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have good education for our children who are being absolutely starved for proper education.\\nSo Sarah, I mean, you know, you can call it what you want, but I am a truth-teller and I will tell the truth, OK?\\nYeah, go ahead, finish it.\\nI feel awfully good. I mean, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m watching your people \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m watching your people on \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to be very nice, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to be very nice \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m watching your people on CNN and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m watching the Fox people and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m watching the MSNBC people, too, OK? See? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m becoming diplomatic.  And they are certainly being very nice to me tonight. I mean, you know, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re being very strong. And they are, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re declaring Marco Rubio the big loser of the night, which is true. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win anything. He hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t won anything, period.\\nAnd by the way, and I have to tell you \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and he was very, very nasty. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never heard a person get up and speak on an evening like this and be so nasty, but he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got a right to be nasty. He hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t won anything and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to win very much.\\nBut I do congratulate Ted because I know how hard Ted worked on Texas and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a big get. Now I also did very well in Texas. I came in second. And one of the things my son, Eric, told me, which I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even realize, is that not only did I win most of the states \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and some are coming in and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m expected to win them \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but I came in second \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I came in no worse than second. So it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like I won and then I disappeared. The worst I had was a second. So I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very, very honored by the turnout, OK?\\nYes, go ahead.\\nRight. Oh, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re totally wrong. Look, I disavowed. I disavowed when I \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in fact, Chris is my number one \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Chris gave me the honor of joining the campaign. He called me. He said, \"Donald, what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got is a movement.\" We spoke today in Kentucky. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never seen a crowd like that. That had to be 20,000 people inside this massive convention center and it was incredible. And every place we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re speaking, if we have 10,000 people it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like a small group. We had 35,000 people the other day in Alabama. And when Chris called, he said this is a movement; this is something like I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never seen. And in all fairness to the press, a lot of the press have said the same thing. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never seen what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening right now. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never seen anything like it. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m just honored by it.\\nNow, when Chris joined, we had a news conference and they asked me the exact same question. I said I disavow. Now, right after the program that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and I thought it was clear, but you know, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about groups, groups, groups. I do have to know the name of the group because, who knows? I mean, they have to give me the name of the group. But right after, when I reviewed it, I put out a tweet and I put out on Facebook that I totally disavow. Now everybody knew I did that but the press refused to look at that. It was right after. And I disavowed then; I disavowed today on ABC with George Stephanopoulos, I disavowed again. I mean, how many times are you supposed to disavow? But I disavow and hopefully it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the final time I have to do it. But if you look at Facebook and if you look at Twitter, right after the show I put out a statement because I want everybody to be sure.\\nYes, go ahead.\\nNo, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not, but there is always going to be some negotiation, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be a good negotiation, not a bad negotiation. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be a negotiation where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll start at certain levels and hopefully I will make a great deal, and lots of great deals, for the American people.\\nSo you know, look, you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go around just signing our little notices that the president signs all the time, executive orders, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s done executive order, executive order. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s almost like, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know. Does he ever go a deal with Congress anymore? Does he ever speak to the Senate? Does he ever speak with congressmen and get them into a room and get things done?\\nYou know, a good example of this, in all fairness, is something that I \\xe2\\x80\\x94 is very, very important to me; corporate inversion. Carl Icahn, who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a friend of mine who endorsed me, great businessman, he \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it bothers him so much he calls me about it all the time, where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re losing companies. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re losing for two reasons. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re losing for a lot of reasons but the taxes are too high. We have the highest \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the highest taxed nation in the world.\\nAnd very importantly, they have trillions, for companies, trillions of dollars outside of this country. The Democrats agree it should be brought back in. The Republicans agree it should be brought back in. Everybody agrees it should be brought back in. I could sit in a room \\xe2\\x80\\x94 or the Oval Office \\xe2\\x80\\x94 for a period of, literally, a half hour and I really believe I could get everybody \\xe2\\x80\\x94 every single \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one thing they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t agree on health care or they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t agree on common core or they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t agree on other things and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll fight. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something every single \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I mean, almost everybody agrees. These trillions and trillions of dollars should be brought into the country.\\nThe president can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make a deal. The reason is he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how to make a deal, probably doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work at it, probably doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care, but you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about tremendous number of \\xe2\\x80\\x94 tremendous amounts of money. So when you have something that everybody wants and you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make a deal, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something going on that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really wrong. And what it means is you have the wrong leader.\\nYes?\\nWell, look, everything \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we are going to have a wall. I can tell you we are going to have a wall. I watched the ex-president of Mexico, the arrogance of this man. And I get along great with Hispanics. You saw in Nevada, I won in the poll, the Hispanic vote. I have thousands of people that work for me right now that are Hispanic. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had thousands and thousands over my lifetime. These are great people. The Mexican leaders are too smart for our leaders and you saw it. Vincente Fox, first of all, he used a word that you should never have \\xe2\\x80\\x94 if I ever used that word you folks would\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never, ever, ever let me get away with it. Nobody even talked about the word he used and this is the ultimate word. But he was angry at the concept of somebody saying that they were going to pay for the wall. Mexico is going to pay for the wall. We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year \\xe2\\x80\\x94 $58 billion. The wall is going to cost $10 billion. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so easy. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had these guys that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m on the stage with go you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really mean Mexico is going to pay for the wall. One \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as sure as you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re standing there, 100 percent, Mexico\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to pay, 100 percent.\\nAnd the reason is I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a businessman. I know how to do this. Politicians are all talk, no action. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to \\xe2\\x80\\x94 except for Chris Christie, of course.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not \\xe2\\x80\\x94 look, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen with these people.\\nSo when you think of it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and then they say you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never be able to build a wall. Well, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2,000 miles but we really need 1,000 miles. The Great Wall of China, built 2,000 years ago, is 13,000 miles, folks, and they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have Caterpillar tractors, because I only want to use Caterpillar, if you want to know the truth, or John Deere. I buy a lot of equipment from John Deere. I love John Deere, too. But they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have tractors. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have cranes. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have excavation equipment. The wall is 13,000 miles long. We need 1,000 miles and we have all of the materials. We can do that so beautifully. And this is going to be a serious wall. This is going to be high wall. This is going to be a very serious wall.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to stop drugs from coming into New Hampshire. You know, when I won New Hampshire, those people were so incredible to me. And when you go, you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so bucolic, so beautiful. You look at the fields and you look at everything, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so beautiful. And yet, you go to a meeting in New Hampshire, their number one problem, their number one problem is heroine. The heroine is pouring in and they have so many of their young people and other people addicted. And I told them I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to stop it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to stop it. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have a strong border, and I mean strong.\\nAnd by the way, speaking of people, people are going to come in and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to come into this country, but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to come in legally, OK?\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to find out what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a big problem. We have a big, big problem. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell it like it is. We have a big, big problem. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to figure it out. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to figure it out. Radical Islamic terrorism, big, big problem, not only for us. You take a look at Germany, you take a look at Sweden, you take a look at Brussels. You look at some of these places, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like a disaster. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to allow people to come into our country who we have no idea who they are, we have no idea where they come from, they have no paperwork, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re young and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re strong. You look at that migration line; they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re young, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re strong, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re powerful. And you say why aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they back fighting for their country?\\nNow, with all of that being said, I feel strongly \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I have a bigger heart than anybody. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to build a safe zone. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be in Syria. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to get the Gulf states, who have more money than anybody \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to loosen up their wallets a little bit. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not accepting people. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get \\xe2\\x80\\x94 wait, wait, wait. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get the Gulf states to pay for it because they should.\\nOh, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to bring them back. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to bring them back. Look, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m telling you \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you know how I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to bring them back? First of all, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do great with the African- Americans, and you see that in the polls where I had in one poll where I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m 25 percent. And one of the commentators, who I think is standing right at the back of the room in the corner, said, you know, if Donald Trump gets 25 percent of the African-American vote, this election is over. You watch. And the reason I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m getting that \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do great with the Hispanics. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do great with virtually every group. The reason is I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to bring jobs back. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to get Apple to start making their computers and their iPhones on our land, not in China. How does it help us when they make it in China?\\nWell, look, I always liked Marco until about a week ago when he decided to go hostile. He decided to become Don Rickles, OK? But Don Rickles has a lot more talent. Honestly, I did, I always liked him but he became \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you know, somebody told him you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re losing very badly. The only way you can possibly win, take the hail Mary, they called it a hail Mary, the folks in the back, and go hostile. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hurt him. In fact, one of the newscasts tonight said he went down 15 or 20 percent. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really hurt him.\\nBut look, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to tell him what to do. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to tell anybody what to do. You have to run. He had a bad night, according to CNN, Fox. I watched their broadcasts. They say the loser of the night was Marco Rubio and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win anything. He hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t won. I mean, at least you can say that Ted has won something, and you know, Marco has not won. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to be able to win. You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk. You know, these politicians, all talk, no action. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to be able to win something. He hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t won anything. And he actually hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come very close. So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see what happens.\\nYes, go ahead.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to be a good president for the world but we have a country that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in big trouble. Our infrastructure is going to hell, our roads, our highways, our schools, our hospitals, our airports. I go throughout the world. I mean, you go to Qatar, you go to \\xe2\\x80\\x94 some people say Qatar, but you go to Qatar, you go to any of \\xe2\\x80\\x94 so many places. You go to different places in China, different places in Asia, different places in the Middle East, you look at some of the airports they have. You look at the roadways they have. You look at the transportation systems they have and the trains they have. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re like a third world country.\\nSo I am going to be very good for the world. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to get along with the world. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be very proud of me. Even you will be very proud of me as a president. But we have to rebuild our country. Our country is going to hell and people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand that.\\nAnd Hillary Clinton doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a clue. She can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talking about \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I mean, one of the things that has really bothered me, I think one of the reasons I have such great support, is that people, you take a look, people in the middle-income groups are making less money today \\xe2\\x80\\x94 less money than they made 12 years ago. And in her speech, she just said they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re making less money. Well, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been there with Obama for a long period of time. Why hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t she done anything about it? Practically everything that she was complaining about \\xe2\\x80\\x94 she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s picked up what I say. The difference is she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been there for a long period of time. Why haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they done anything about it?\\nThen you look at her record as secretary of State. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s abysmal. You look at what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on with Syria. You look at what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on with everything. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a disaster.\\nSo we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have an interesting period of time. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be allowed to run. What she did is a criminal act. If she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s allowed to run I would be very, very surprised. But if she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s allowed to run, honestly, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be a sad day for this country because what she did was wrong. And what she did \\xe2\\x80\\x94 (CHEERS) \\xe2\\x80\\x94 let me just tell you, what she did was wrong and other people have done far less than her and they paid a very, very big price.\\nOK, one or two more questions. Yeah, go ahead, Jeremy\\nAt this moment, absolutely not, no. We either have a country or we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. We have a country, or we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. We have borders or we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have borders. And at this moment, the answer is absolutely not.\\nWell, look, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expect \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I have a lot of respect for Reince and for the group and I like the RNC and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been treated fairly or not. I really don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell you that. But I can tell you that I do respect them.\\nWhat I really have is a great number of people. I have millions and millions of people. And when I was watching this broadcast just a little while ago, before I came in here because I wanted to see exactly where we were before I started speaking, I was amazed at the kind of numbers. The Republicans have tremendous energy. The Democrats don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any energy. Their numbers are down. Our number are through the roof. And people are making the statements they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never seen, in modern times, a party that was so energized.\\nI think if somebody is doing as well as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not just speaking for myself, whether it be me or anybody else \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to win five \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve already won five, but maybe it could be six, seven, eight, nine. It could be nine, could win nine states tonight. If I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to win all of these states with tremendous numbers, and if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to come in the worst is second in the two or three that I might not win, I think, you know, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a democracy. I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s awfully hard to say that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the person we want to lead the party, right? You know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very hard.\\nBut I really think that \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great question, David, because I really think that one of the biggest things that everybody is seeing happening, and everybody, is the Republican Party has become more dynamic. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s become more diverse. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re taking from the Democrats. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re taking from the independents. We have a lot more people. We have a lot more people. I mean, take a look at South Carolina. Look at the numbers. Look at the numbers from four years ago when nobody even wanted to waste their time and vote. And then you look at \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I was there and you had lines that went a mile long. And it was virtually more than doubled.\\nSo we have a very, very dynamic party and I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be able to unify the party. I hope to be able to get along with everybody. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know Paul Ryan well but I hope to be able to get along with him. I do know Mitch McConnell a little bit but I hope to be able to get along with him. But remember this. I have millions and millions and millions of people. This isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a close match. I mean, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only too bad that winner didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take all, because if winner took all, this thing is over. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re just having a celebration.\\nYou know, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re having a celebration.\\nSo anyway, I would like to \\xe2\\x80\\x94 look, I just want to end by thanking everybody. This has been an amazing period in my life. My wife just called and Ivanka, as you know, is going to be having a baby very soon and she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a special person and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be great and we look forward to that. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s back in New York. She wanted to be here. They all wanted to be here but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re with Ivanka now and that could be, certainly, within the next week. But this this has been an amazing period of time. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been amazing for me, even from an educational standpoint. And I think, honestly, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done something that almost nobody thought could be done and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very proud of it.\\nAnd I just want to leave you with this. I am a unifier. I would love to see the Republican Party and everybody get together and unify. And when we unify, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nobody, nobody that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to beat us.\\nThank you very much everybody. Thank you.\\nThank you very much. Thank you.\\n  \\nThis is so \\xe2\\x80\\x94 so incredible. \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\n We \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we have had, no matter where we go \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a movement, folks. This is a movement.\\nNo matter where we go, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amazing. We go to Dallas. We go to Oklahoma. We go all over. We went to, the other night, Iowa \\xe2\\x80\\x94 packed. Every place \\xe2\\x80\\x94 New Hampshire, packed. Every place we go to, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like this. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amazing. And just great, great people.\\nAnd they actually had to tell over 3,000 people, \"go home.\" We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll come back. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do another one. But they had to go home. Would you like to leave and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll let them come in? No?\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think so, but we \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they turned away a lot of people, which is too bad, actually. So maybe next time. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. I think this is the largest room. I know it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a record for the room.\\nYou know, it has to be a record because every inch of the room is taken with people, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re standing. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not sitting. So that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great. I love \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we love setting records. We want the country to set records, right?\\nSo, you know, I \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I do this, and I love to do it. And I talk about our success because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ultimately what it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all about. I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do fantastically well in Iowa. I really think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do great there. And I could say, \"Oh, gee, if we came in the top four of five.\" I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking to win everything. We want to run the table. We want to run it, because that sends a signal.\\nAnd, you know, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been a little bit \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we had to respond to Hillary. She came out with that \\xe2\\x80\\x94 she came out \\xe2\\x80\\x94 remember, she wrote \\xe2\\x80\\x94 she said, \"He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got a \\xe2\\x80\\x94 he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s demonstrated a penchant\" \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I demonstrated \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \"a penchant for sexism.\" Can you believe it? Me? Nobody respects women more than Donald Trump. That I can tell you.\\nAnd, you know, when she said that, I had no choice, because I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t start it. I had no choice. And I did have to mention her husband\\xe2\\x80\\x99s situation. OK?\\n(Laughter)\\nAnd that is now the biggest story on television by a factor of 10. So, we have to do it. You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let people push you around. You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let people tell lies. You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it.\\n You know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interesting. One of the polls came out from CNBC and they said that if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Trump against Hillary in the election, it will be the greatest voter turnout in the history of this country. I can see that. I can see it.\\nAnd they said all of these people that are going to come in new, that never vote \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they never vote, they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to mostly \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to vote for Trump. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re coming in, because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re so fed up with the system \\xe2\\x80\\x94 this corrupt, horrible system. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re fed up with it and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re fed up with those guys back there, the media.\\nTRUMP: They are the worst.\\nNo, no, no. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re fed up. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re fed up with the media. I mean, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and you know, not all bad, but there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so much dishonesty in the media. And I like to call it out. And one of the things that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really been amazing to me, and such \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been so beautiful to watch \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the level of genius in the public. They get it, you know? They really get it. They want to marginalize us, they want to do all of this and they want to make everybody look like, \"Oh, gee.\"\\nThe level of genius \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they fully understand. They know they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re crooked, they know they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re dishonest and they really \\xe2\\x80\\x94 otherwise, who gets worse publicity than me?\\n(Laughter)\\nAnd yet, I see a poll at 42 percent. And you know, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about 15, 16 people, started with 17. How are you? Started with 17 people. And you know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be happy with 42 if we had three, OK? Not thrilled, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to be that \\xe2\\x80\\x94 over that 50 mark, but I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing really well.\\nAnd you know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interesting, but the debates \\xe2\\x80\\x94 OK. So the debates \\xe2\\x80\\x94 thank \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I love you too, darling.\\n(Laughter)\\nI love you. I do. I love you. I love every \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you know what? The rooms, no matter where, whether it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stadiums or big ballrooms like this one, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amazing, and there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s love in the room. And I told \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the other night, I said and a friend of mine, very, very successful guy who I would love to have negotiating against China. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we need, not these hacks that we have.\\nNo, no. I have guys ...\\nCarl Icahn endorsed me. Great business man. We have \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I have great, great business people that want to be involved. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to use \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we have the best. We have the best in the world. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use them. We use political hacks, we use special interest people that really don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care about the country, they care about their deals.\\nThis is going to change so fast. You know, last year, $500 billion trade deficit with China. Think about it. You know what $500 billion is? You do \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you do $100 bills, you would fill the room to the ceiling, $500 billion deficit \\xe2\\x80\\x94 trade deficit with China. What are we? Are we \\xe2\\x80\\x94 yes, I guess the answer is certainly let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not blame us.\\nOur leaders are stupid and \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and/or \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you have to say and/or they have deals, because what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happened is all of this money is being given to them by special interests, by all of these people, including lobbyists, and these lobbyists make our leaders do \\xe2\\x80\\x94 our leaders, can you believe our leaders? This is what \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but they make the leaders of our country do things that they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even want to do because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve given them tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars.\\nI look at this guy Jeb Bush. He spent $59 million on his campaign and he is down in the grave. He is nowhere. No, no. Think of it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to be much more than that. It was actually $59 million a while ago. Every time I turn on an add, I see an ad about Trump. I mean, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not that bad an ad either. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you know.\\nIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do an ad, do an ad. But he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a low-energy person. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face it. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need low-energy. We need lots of energy.\\nBut he spent \\xe2\\x80\\x94 think of it. Think of it. He spent $59 million. I spent nothing, right? Nothing.\\nNow, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to be spending. You probably saw I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to spend \\xe2\\x80\\x94 now, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to start spending a lot of money because I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to take any chances. You know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I love getting up \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and for the last couple of months, I have been leading from practically the time I announced, right? And for the last \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and leading a lot. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to go over that because I go over (ph) polls. I love polls. I love polls.\\nNow, when they \\xe2\\x80\\x94 if they turn negative, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like them.\\nAnd I promise, if they turn negative, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to be talking about them. In fact, I get criticized all the time. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re always talking about your polls. One of these guys just got two. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s at two. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m at 42. And one of these guys who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s at two said, \"He always talks about his polls and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\" I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t either if I had two, I swear I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\nI wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it at all. But you know, I love to tell the story where I have spent nothing and Bush has spent $59 million, but much higher than that. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you know, because I see since then \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I mean, just \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t turn on this television without these commercials. And Fox \\xe2\\x80\\x94 every two minutes it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a commercial on Trump.\\nYou know what he did? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s false advertising. So I killed him in the debate. According to Reuters, according to everybody, Drudge, who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an amazing guy, by the way. If you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know Drudge \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Matt Drudge. Right? He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great guy. But Drudge, 46 percent. At 46 percent, you have 15 people. Now, if you noticed a couple have dropped out. A couple or more.\\nBut 15, 16 people \\xe2\\x80\\x94 46 percent. Time magazine, 49 percent. Think of it. Slate, 51 percent. U.S. News and World Report \\xe2\\x80\\x94 69 percent said I won the debate. I wont the debate, right?\\nPBS, Public Broadcasting System \\xe2\\x80\\x94 69 percent said Trump won.\\nNo, you know, it is amazing. We have Washington Times at 62 percent. CBS, 59 percent. Fox, 62 percent \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Fox Las Vegas, 62 percent. So, they all say \\xe2\\x80\\x94 then they go back home, after the debate. I like to see how did I do? Did I look good? Looking good is very important, right? Sometimes, it is not as much like what you say, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how did you look?\\nOh, I looked good, didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sound too good, but that is OK. You wonder if that is a good trait. But I go home, and I watch, and the pundits will say \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t totally kill me, because we know it is happening, we know what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening \\xe2\\x80\\x94 well, Mr. Trump was OK tonight. He was \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I won every single online poll, I won.\\nAnd then, here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Bush. So, Bush does an ad. And he takes me \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and he was talking about, you know, something, and manage \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and then I killed him. I mean, he \\xe2\\x80\\x94 by the way, I met 69 percent, he is at 1 percent, he got. He came in last.\\nHe takes the ad \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and I shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even talk about him. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s down to two or three \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but it bothers me when I see a guy spending, you know, $60 million on ads against me, a lot of it, right? I say, why is he doing this? Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he have something better, he should go home.\\nJust relax. You know, honestly, he should go home and relax. He shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be wasting his time. But it does. I say, why is this guy spending all this money? Now he is spending it actually against a couple of other guys, they were also very weak and somewhere \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but here is my ad. So, he made a statement, and after that, his spin people said, oh, he was great. He took on Trump, he took on Trump. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m standing here, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s over here. Took on Trump, he made a statement that was written by his pollster. You know? So, he would remember (ph) it.\\nHe said, \"Mr. Trump, why don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you this?\" I said, OK. Then I gave him an answer. I said, \"Jeb, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m at 42, you are at 2. Right? It is a simple answer. You started off here, right next to me, and then you were there, then you were there, by the next time, you are going to be off the stage. Right?\\nNo, no, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. And then \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and then \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and that was it. And so I responded. So, he asked me a question, question was fine. You know, professionally written. So, he asked me a question, good. I give him an answer, I blow him away. Right. Everyone says Trump won the debate. Everybody. And hat is it. So, the ad is him asking the question and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m standing there like this, because I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in fact, you see in one of them, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m just about ready to open my mouth.\\nBut he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let me respond. That is almost false advertising, isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it? You know? So, I mentioned it, Hillary is a disaster. I mean, Hillary.\\nHillary is controlled by her money. So is Jeb. So is \\xe2\\x80\\x94 by the way, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the only one self-funding my campaign. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m self-funding.\\nYou know, one of the things that makes me happy. I heard one of my commentators this morning, said, \"you know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been watching this stuff for 50 years and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never seen anything like what has happened with Trump. One of them actually said \\xe2\\x80\\x94 one of them \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m special. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re special. I like you. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m special.\\nIsn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that nice? That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very \\xe2\\x80\\x94 every once in a while, somebody can say something that hits you. Where are you? Who said that? Wow. So nice. Thank you. That is a nice one. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like, you know, very once in a while, there is a statement that is either nice or brutal. I think low-energy was a brutal statement, right?\\nLow-energy can be applied to Hillary. I just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like to use the same thing twice on one of my enemies. Right? Because I consider them enemies. We view this as war. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we view this as war? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s war.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s war. And so, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like to use it. I hate to give it up. What?\\n How are you going to help my little girl (ph), daughter?  Oh, we are going to help your daughter. We are going to help the country, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called helping the daughter. We are going to help your country. So, here is the story. So, we are in a situation where we have incompetent leadership, where our trade deals are killing us, our military is not prepared. General Odierno when he left, just recently, he said that we are less prepared than at any time that he can remember. And I think he went back tot he beginning, but let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s say second World War. OK? That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enough.\\nAnd we should be very prepared now, because the world hates us. She has done a terrible job as secretary of State. Think of it. Putin comes out, he said, Donald Trump is brilliant, he is doing an amazing job, and he is leading the pack. OK, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nice.\\n And she and my opponents \\xe2\\x80\\x94 oh, isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it terrible that Putin said \\xe2\\x80\\x94 wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it be nice if we could get along with the world? Wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it be? Seriously. No, no, wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it be nice?\\nI mean, they want me to refute his statement. How dare you say I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m brilliant? How dare \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x94 who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to do that? And by the way, if he said it about anyone of them, they would have been very happy.\\nBut the point is, we have to get along. The world has blown up around Barack Obama.\\nNow, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if you saw his recent release. They were talking about the Department of State, State Department, and they said very strongly, you know, the things that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done. Well, they couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t find it because what have they done that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good? And they said bringing peace to Syria. Did you see that?\\nSo instead of saying they made a mistake \\xe2\\x80\\x94 call it a typo, they made a mistake \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re trying to justify it. Well, we meant we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re working on it. Can you believe \\xe2\\x80\\x94 bringing peace to Syria. The world is blowing up, the migration in Syria \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they say one of their achievements for the year is bringing peace to Syria, and the whole world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talking about it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the level of stupidity is incredible. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m telling you. I used to use the word incompetent, now I just call them stupid.\\nI went to an Ivy League school, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very highly educated. I know words, I had the best words. I have \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no better word than stupid.\\nRight? There is none. There is none.\\nThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no \\xe2\\x80\\x94 there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no \\xe2\\x80\\x94 there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no word like that. So we are going to turn things around. But \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and if we have Hillary \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to tell you. I just saw where for the last week she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been hitting me really hard with the women card, OK? Really hard. And I had to say OK, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enough, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enough. And we did a strong number. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to win. Any by the way, I love the concept \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I love, love, love having a woman president. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be her. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s horrible. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s horrible.\\n And you know really don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you who does not like \\xe2\\x80\\x94 yeah, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get Ivanka. Good. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s do Ivanka.\\nBut I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you who doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like Hillary are women. Women don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like Hillary.\\nI see it all the time. And always so theatrical; Mr. Trump said this and that and this. And you just \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I actually \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it. I just have to turn off the television so many times. She just gives me a headache.\\nBut you know \\xe2\\x80\\x94 although I think last night I gave her a big headache.\\nI can imagine \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I can imagine those discussions. But you have to hit back hard, and you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let them push you around. And today, she gave a speech and she never even mentioned my name. You know, in the debate I was mentioned nine times, I mean everything. All of them. But her. I was mentioned nine times, none of the other candidates were mentioned. And then she came out with the sexism, which is so nonsense. And \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s playing that card. And then I had to hit her back, so I hit her back and I talked about her husband and the abuse of women and the tremendous abuse \\xe2\\x80\\x94 no, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tremendous abuse.\\nI mean, you look at it, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tremendous abuse. And I talked about that. And now today, the television is going crazy, and she gets up, makes a speech and doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even mention anything about me with sexism or anything else. I wonder why \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I wonder why.\\nAnd remember this; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really important. A poll just came out where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re tied, another one came out a couple of weeks ago, Fox, where I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m leading by four or five points against her individually. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing great. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even focused on her yet.\\nLook at the people I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve focused on. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to really knock them, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to mention their names. But, you know, of those people that are all gone, they were all people that attacked me. Wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it be nice if our country could have that same thing? You attack and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re, boom, gone. And if we could do it verbally \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 you know, if we could do it verbally that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s even better, right? You know, who wants to use our military? By the way, we are going to build the strongest, the best, the most powerful military ever. Ever. Ever.\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take care of our vets, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take care of our vets \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\n And it will cost you much less money, and it will be great. I mean, you are signing in programs, things that you will never, ever use, You know that. And you are paying for it. And you will never ever use them. So we will get that straightened out. We are going to straighten a lot of things. We are going to straighten out Common Core. Common Core is dead. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be dead.\\n When I look at parents and I see local parents in Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina, I went to a school and I saw the parents, they love their children. They want that \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they want education. They love \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care about money, they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care about anything. They love their children and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s local.\\nAnd they get together and they do wonderful programs. They are smart people as opposed to getting it done by bureaucrats that are getting big, fat checks in Washington. I mean, we have such talent in this country and we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use it. So, Obamacare, dead. Common core, gone. We are going to get rid of it. Department of Education, we are going to get rid of it.\\n We are bringing education to a local level. One thing on education. So, in the world, we are ranked number 28. There are third world countries that are ranked better than us in education and many other things. And yet, per pupil, we are number 1, by far \\xe2\\x80\\x94 there is nobody close. Number two isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even close.\\nSo we spend more money for pupil than any country in the world and we are ranked number 28 which is way down at the bottom, essentially. I mean, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x94 can you imagine we are ranked number 28 and we are number 1? And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I do like saying about my campaign, I spent less money than anybody else and I have the best results.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m number one by a lot and I spent no money. I mean, my plane cost me some money, but I spent no ads. Took a little radio ad in Iowa. But I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I took \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I think the station is so lovely if you want to know the truth. But I spent essentially no money.\\nAnd then you have all these other guys spending vast \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and they like the way the United States is run. Now, why would we put a guy like Jeb, like some of the others. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not only Jeb Bush. They spend money. I see Rubio on the ads all day long.\\nYou know, the black background. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got like a black thing. He should have put something like that behind him, right? Right there, the flag.\\n No, no. And I like him. I think he is a nice guy. But I see these ads with the backdrop and it is just somber. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good. So, think of it. I spent no money and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m number one. Others spent \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they will have spent hundreds of millions of dollars and they are not even in the race. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we need for our country. What? OK. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got 15,000, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what the hell he means by that but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s OK. So, but I think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a fan. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a \\xe2\\x80\\x94 are you a protester? No. OK. No body likes Trump. OK. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a protester. I love you.\\n You know, the only time \\xe2\\x80\\x94 don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry about it. The only time the cameras focus on the crowd is when we have a protester. Cause I always have \\xe2\\x80\\x94 like, look at this room, packed. I always have the biggest crowds.\\nAnd I go home and my wife said were there many people? I watched you on television tonight. I said, I had 20,000 people. She said, they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t show it. They have it right on your face. So I have 20,000 people. I have 20,000 in Oklahoma, 35,000 in Mobile, Alabama. Nobody knows. Because those cameras stay right in your face and I think they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t move.\\nYou know, I think they might be fixed because modern cameras maybe \\xe2\\x80\\x94 except every time there is a guy that stands up protesting, you know, they are on drugs or something, cause some of those guys, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know what the hell they are doing there, all the sudden, the cameras swerve and make perfect shots.\\nAnd I like it because then it shows how big the crowds are. So, you know. Some time I think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to put in some false protesters. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll put in some friendly protesters. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the only way I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to be able to get the crowd in.\\nSo when we started, I talked about trade. I talked about the border. I talked about a lot of things. And I started on June 16th and \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in Trump Tower, the famous escalator ride. And it takes guts to run for president. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you, you know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never did this before.\\nAnd, you know, then they tell you on a debate we had the largest debate. We have the largest audience in the history of cable television. Then CNN a couple of weeks later had 23 million. Fox had 24 million. CNN had 23 million \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the largest audience in the history of CNN.\\nNow, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re there \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the cameras are on live right now. I mean, you know. So, the largest audience in the history of (inaudible).\\nNow, the debates used to be, if you go back four years or eight years, you know, whenever the cycles came up, nobody even wanted \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want the debates. I think they were forced to take them for licensing. Nobody wanted the debates. They drew nothing, but now they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re drawing 24 million. Now they want to have more debates \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \"Oh, can we have more? Can we have more?\" Can they go three hours?\\nDo you remember when they had the one go three hours? I said, no, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not doing three hours. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too long. Who wants \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I could stand up here for 50 hours, but who the hell wants to sit home watching three hours of the stuff, right?\\n\"Mr. Trump, you have 30 seconds. What would you do about ISIS?\" Oh, great. And by the way, that question \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I hate those questions. You know why? Because I want to be unpredictable. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to tell ISIS what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do to knock the hell out of them.\\nRemember, I said very strongly \\xe2\\x80\\x94 (inaudible) the oil for what, four years? You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been watching. I mean, four years. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been \"get the oil, get the oil, get the oil.\" Because who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to get the oil? Iran is taking over Iraq. We made a deal for Iran, done by some of the dumbest people on earth, on our side. We gave them everything. They \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even get our prisoners back.\\nAnd now Iran wants to start negotiating separately for them. Can you believe it? I go crazy. We would have gotten them back. All you had to do was say, \"We want our prisoners back.\" They would have said no. I would have said, \"I want them back; you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand me. I want them back.\" They would have said, \"No, we won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that.\" I would have said, \"Bye-bye,\" and I would have left. Then I would have doubled up the sanctions. And I guarantee you...\\n... I guarantee you that within 24 hours, they would have called back and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say, \"You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got your prisoners; can we talk?\"\\nAnd I would have never given them $150 billion. I would have never given them the money. I would have never give \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re using it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to make nuclear. They can buy it. Why are they going to make it? Then we have the nuclear, where they have self- inspections. How about the area \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you know, the big area? They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want us there. Oh, I wonder why. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want us there. So they self-inspect, OK?\\nThen they have the 24-day inspection, but the self-inspection is the beauty. \"We think you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re making nuclear weapons here.\" \"Well, let us go check, Mr. President, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll check.\"\\n\"No, sir, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not making nuclear weapons. Nobody \\xe2\\x80\\x94 no, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not; we would never do a thing like that.\"\\nThese are people that have deceived us. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve lied to us. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a terrorist state. But \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and I used to say it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the worst deal that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen negotiated. And by the way, just to finish prisoners. So they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d come back; we get our prisoners. But then when I hear the other day that now this deal is done. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all done. And now I hear they want to negotiate to get \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and what do they say? They said very strongly, they said, \"We are going to want a lot for the prisoners. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s out \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re starting off; we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to want a lot.\"\\nNow, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve already taken off the sanctions. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re already rich as hell. What \\xe2\\x80\\x94 what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on there? That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why I say, I mean, some people say it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worst than stupidity. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something going on that we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know about. I mean, honest. And you almost think \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not saying that, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not a conspiracy person. As you said, \"We are; we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re saying it.\"\\nHalf the people in this room are saying it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m trying to be \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m just hoping they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re just stupid people, OK?\\nWhich they are. Or there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something going on. Because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inconceivable. You know, do you ever see where some things are so bad that it can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that nobody can do what they did, right? Nobody.\\nSo, Iran now wants to negotiate separately for the (inaudible). In other words, that deal is done; now we want to start all over again. And they want a lot. \"We want a lot.\" And I just \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I want to just shoot the television, you know? Because they would have had it just by saying.\\nAnd, you know, when they asked Kerry and Obama, the deal was made. Everybody knows it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a horrible deal. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to need to \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to lead to tremendous nuclear proliferation, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re so rich now. You know, they became \\xe2\\x80\\x94 $150 billion \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they became so rich. And many other things that you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know about. Most people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know what the agreement says.\\n But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what, when you look at what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to have \\xe2\\x80\\x94 if we keep going like this, folks, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to have a country left. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to have a country. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to have a country.\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re like a dumping ground for the world. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a dumping ground. They want to take these migrants \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the migrants, you know, and I feel terrible about the migration, caused by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the ones that caused it. They go into Libya. They knocked the hell out of Gadhafi. OK, so Gadhafi \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they backed rebels who end up killing the ambassador and the other young people.\\nYou know the ambassador was riding in a jeep, one of our jeeps, of course, a military jeep, holding the Libyan flag and you know, freedom, freedom, freedom. And then gets killed by the same people. So, we backed people that turned out to be far worse than Gadhafi.\\nLook at what we did in Iraq. Look at what we did in Iraq. I mean, what the hell did we get? We spent $2 trillion, and that was as a year and a half ago. I keep saying two or three, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot more than that. We spent $2 trillion, we have thousands of deaths, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not even talking other side.\\nYou are talking about hundreds of thousands, maybe millions. You have thousands of deaths. We have wounded warriors, who I love, all of. These guys are the toughest \\xe2\\x80\\x94 these are the greatest people.\\n You know, these are the greatest people. And then what happens? We leave, and we have a president that announces the date of when we are leaving. So, I said, man, if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the enemy, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m just going to go wait for 18 months right?\\nHe gave a date. We are leaving Iraq, we will be gone by such and such a time. I said, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m just sitting there watching and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m saying, man, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really stupid. Because, believe me, the enemy doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to be killed. You know, you hear so much, oh they want to go with the virgins up to wherever they go, right?\\nThey don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. They want to live. And they want to take care of their families, always their families. You remember that, because their families know what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on OK? You think their wives don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what they are planning? You think their kids don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know exactly what daddy is doing when daddy is going to fly into the World Trade Center? You think they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know? They know exactly what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on. Remember that. And frankly, I think they have more love for their family\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lives than they do for their own lives, OK. But they still want to live. So here is Obama, gives an exact date. He gives an exact date and so they pull back.\\nAnd everyone says, oh, we are doing so well. Look, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing so well. Why should they fight when they know, in 18 months, they can go in and take the place? So what happens? So we have ISIS taking a lot of oil. I said take the oil. Remember when we left, I was opposed to going in because I said you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to destabilize the Middle East.\\nBecause you had Iraq and you had Iran. And I said, they fight, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re always fighting for decades and decades, for generations. They fight, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what they do. They fight. How we ever got involved in this mess is hard to believe. They fight and they were equal militarily. They go this way, 10 feet. They go this way, 10 feet. Then they rest a couple of years, then they start fighting again.\\nThen Saddam Hussein throws a little gas. Everyone goes crazy. Oh, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because (ph) of gas. They go back and forth. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the same. And they were stabilized. And I said, if you go after one or the other, in this case Iraq, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to destabilize the Middle East. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what going to happen. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to destabilize the Middle East. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exactly what happened. We totally destabilized the Middle East.\\nWe have now migrations ,largely because of what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happened afterwards. You know Iraq was horrible. It was stupid to go in and we should have never gone in. But we shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have gotten out the way we went out. And we shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have given dates. I mean, I would have probably said we are going to stay forever. And they would have said, oh, man.\\nAnd then keep going, keep going and eventually they would get tired and say, this guy is crazy. I mean, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s never going to leave and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll make a deal. But when you announce you are leaving in 18 months or whatever the hell he said, they just pull back. And then as soon as we left, they come in OK?\\nSo they have the oil. You know who the biggest benefactor of the oil is right? China. Always China. I love China. I love Mexico. Their leaders are too smart for us. We have no border. We will build a wall. Mexico will pay for the wall by the way.\\n We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re building a wall, we are going to have a border. And people are going to come into our country, but they are going to come in through a legal process. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not coming in the way they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re coming in now, just walking in like nothing.\\nThey are going to come in, but they are going to come through a legal process. So, with Iraq, so we give them the date and they take over. We didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take the year. So for four years, I have been talking about it. Then because of Paris, all of sudden they start bombing the oil.\\nBut I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to just bomb the oil. I wanted to take oil. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re bombing. You know, we are bombing. Great. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to happen after that? So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re bombing. And, you know, we are not really bombing it, because they are still selling it.\\n I said, how could they keep selling it? Obama does not want to hit them too hard because he is afraid he is going to pollute the atmosphere. No, this is serious. Now think of it. He talks about the carbon footprint and yet he will fly a very old Air Force one, an old Boeing 747, with the old engines and you know, spewing stuff.\\nSo, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got a problem with the carbon footprint. You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use hair spray because hair spray is going to affect the ozone. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m trying to figure out. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s see, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in my room in New York City and I want to put a little spray so that I can \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 right? Right? But I hear where they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want me to use hair spray, they want me to use the pump because the other one which I really like better than going bing, bing, bing \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x94 and then it comes out in big globs, right, and you \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stuck in your hair and you say oh my God, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to take a shower again. My hair\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all screwed up, right?\\nI want to use hair spray. They say don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use hair spray, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bad for the ozone. So I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sitting in this concealed apartment, this concealed unit \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you know, I really do live in a very nice apartment, right?\\nBut it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sealed, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beautiful. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think anything gets out. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not supposed to be using hair spray. But think of it. So Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always talking about the global warming, that global warming is our biggest and most dangerous problem, OK? No, no, think of it. I mean, even if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a believer in global warming, ISIS is a big problem, Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a problem, China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a problem. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a lot of problems. By the way, the maniac in North Korea is a problem. He actually has nuclear weapons, right? That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a problem.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a lot of problems. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a lot of problems. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win anymore. He said we want to win. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win anymore. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win a lot \\xe2\\x80\\x94 if I get elected, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win a lot.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win so much \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win a lot. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win a lot. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win so much you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all going to get sick and tired of winning. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to say oh no, not again. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m only kidding. You never get tired of winning, right? Never.\\nBut think of it. So Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talking about all of this with the global warming and the \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a lot of it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a hoax, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a hoax. I mean, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a money-making industry, OK? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a hoax, a lot of it. And look, I want clean air and I want clean water. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my global \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I want clean, clean crystal water and I want clean air. And we can do that, but we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to destroy our businesses, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to destroy our \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nAnd by the way, China isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t abiding by anything. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re buying all of our coal; we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use coal anymore essentially. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re buying our coal and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re using it. Now when you talk about the planet, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so big out there \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re here, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re there, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re our next door neighbor, right, in terms of the universe. Miss Universe, by the way, I made a great deal when I sold \\xe2\\x80\\x94 oh did I get rich.\\nThat was a great deal. You know, they broke my choppers on that. They said he talks about illegal immigration, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to put him on television. First of all, Univision is being sued like crazy; you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it. And NBC, I made a great deal with them, just like an amazing deal, far more than I would have ever gotten \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I mean, I made an unbelievable deal \\xe2\\x80\\x94 far more than I ever would have gotten if I said I think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to sell it if times were normal, right? Isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it amazing the way that stuff can work out?\\nBut I love Miss Universe and I love the universe. But think of it. So China is spewing up all this stuff and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re holding back. And with China \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you know, we signed these agreements where we have to do it now, they have to do it within 30 or 35 years. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be doing it.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like Japan. If somebody attacks Japan, we have to immediately go and start World War III, OK? If we get attacked, Japan doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to help us. Somehow, that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sound so fair. Does that sound good?\\n So South Korea \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I order televisions, I order thousands of televisions a year. I order televisions because I have a lot of stuff and I like nice brand new \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all made in South Korea, most \\xe2\\x80\\x94 other than Sony, and Sony, in all fairness, has lost its way. But a lot of them \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Samsung, all of them. I mean, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all pretty much \\xe2\\x80\\x94 all of them, right? I think just about. But I order thousands of televisions, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all from South Korea. So we have 28,000 people on the border separating South Korea from this maniac in North Korea, we get nothing. What do \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we get nothing. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re making a fortune. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an economic behemoth.\\nA lot of you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know we protect Germany. Germany! Mercedes Benz, how many people have a Mercedes Benz? We protect Germany. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an economic behemoth.\\nWe protect Saudi Arabia. They were, during the good oil days \\xe2\\x80\\x94 now it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably half, which is fine. But during the good old \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they were making a billion \\xe2\\x80\\x94 listen to this \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a billion dollars a day, and we protect them. Our military \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they pay us peanuts, like nothing. And then if we want to buy \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we want to move to another location, well, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very expensive if we do that. We want \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they charge us rent?\\nI mean, look. We are run by people that are so bad, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re so out of their league \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and I see it, I see it on the stage. You know, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a lot of them are nice people. You know, a lot of people think I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like these people. I do like them. But they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have business sense, they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have business ability, they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have common sense. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re politicians, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all talk, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re no action.\\nWhen I say...\\n... folks, when I say, \"We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to build a wall.\" Most of them say, \"You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t build a wall \\xe2\\x80\\x94 build a wall.\" In China 2,000 years ago, they built the Great Wall of China, which is bigger than any wall we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re thinking about, OK? The Great Wall of China goes 18,000 miles. We have 2,000 miles of which we only need 1,000 miles, because you have a lot of natural barriers, right, that are extremely tough to get across. We have 1,000 miles.\\nSo, China has 18,000 or 13,000 miles, and we have 1,000 miles. We have modern cranes. We have Caterpillar tractors \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I want to use Caterpillar; I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to use Komatsu.\\nMade in America.\\nEven my hats, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re made in America. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t easy to find a guy that could do those hats. You know what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m talking about. I see so many knock-offs of my hat, right? \"Make America Great Again.\" I see these things that are out of plastic. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re out of all sorts of crap. Mine are made in America. And honestly, they do a great job, but they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t produce as many as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like because, frankly, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a big \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I mean, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amazing. Those hats are amazing. But I wanted to have it made. And you know why I wanted it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I wanted it, anyway, but I also knew that as soon as the hats came out, and other things \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we have a website \\xe2\\x80\\x94 as soon as the hats came out, I knew the press would be calling. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. First hour when the hats were announced, I get a call from the New York Times. \"Mr. Trump, where are those hats made?\" I said, \"America.\"\\nI knew it. I knew it. Because as you know, if I would have said China, I would have been in big, big trouble. But they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re being knocked off all over the world. I mean, I see hats \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re like helmets. I see them all. But what are you going to do?\\nBut here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the story. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to build a wall. So when I talk and when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m up on the stage with these guys, these people \\xe2\\x80\\x94 wonderful people \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and a very nice woman, Carly. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nice woman. When I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m up on the stage with them, they think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m crazy when I say \"Mexico\" \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m saying, \"We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to build a wall; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be a great wall; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be real wall. See this ceiling? This ceiling is peanuts compared to the height of the wall I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m talking about.\"\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m talking about a van to get up there. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not coming down because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too dangerous.\\nAll right? Did you ever see what they do now? We have these little walls. They build ramps. They build a ramp. I say, \"Wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it be cheaper just to knock the wall down and just...\" And then they drive over it with jeeps loaded up with drugs. Do you see this? They build ramps. There was a picture in Time magazine. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a ramp \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a little ramp that goes over the wall. So, they have a jeep \\xe2\\x80\\x94 over, down, bump, make money. We get the drugs. Think of it. We \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \"build a wall\" is right. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to build a wall.\\nWe get the drugs. They get the cash. No so good, right? We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like that deal. Our politicians don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know.\\nSo when I say \"Mexico\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to pay for it,\" these guys on the stage with me, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not business people. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand. Mexico makes a fortune off the United States. Number one, we give them a lot of money. But in addition to that, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re taking our businesses. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re making \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you talk about a trade deficit. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what, Mexico in a certain way is in a mini-version the new China. Mexico is making an absolute fortune \\xe2\\x80\\x94 peanuts, compared to the cost of the wall.\\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s say the cost of the wall is $10 billion. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I can do great job at $10 billion. I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have a lot of money left over. Somebody else would \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and by the way, 20 years ago, they wanted to build a wall. People that are opposed to it now, they wanted to stop and they wanted to build a wall. You know one of the reasons they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t build the wall? Because of the Environmental Protection Agency, they couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get an environmental impact study approved. Can you believe it? Because there was a toad or a turtle or a snake or something was in the way.\\nNow, think of it. In China, in the South China Sea, there were these low-level land masses that were covered by water, but pretty close to the top. China sends in massive excavators and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re (inaudible). They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re building military fortresses in the South China Sea. And a friend of mine, who is one of the biggest and richest people in China \\xe2\\x80\\x94 he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great guy. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re great people. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re fine. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re just too smart. I mean, the leaders are too smart for our people.\\nThey won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be too smart when I put my people there.\\nWhen they call up, \"We\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to speak to the donor that is negotiating it.\" \"No, no. The donor now is Carl Icahn. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to speak to Carl Icahn.\" You know Carl \\xe2\\x80\\x94 great businessman. You have so many people \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they call all these business people \\xe2\\x80\\x94 call. So, a friend of mine, so I call him, I say, \"You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re actually doing that.\" And then jokingly, I said, \"How long did it take to get started? Did you have to get an environmental impact study approved in order to excavate?\"\\nHe looked at me, goes, \"I \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I hope you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re kidding when you say that.\\nThey conceived of the idea and they started digging four hours later, OK? There is no, you know, go through 25 years of environmental impact, you are going to hurt the snail. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to hurt this. You are going to \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they are doing a big thing.\\nThey excavated \\xe2\\x80\\x94 massive, massive \\xe2\\x80\\x94 take a look, massive. The biggest excavation. They are ripping the hell out of that ocean. They are ripping it and they are taking their dirt and they are putting it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re building air fields and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re building forts.\\nWe couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it because, just like I said for the law. Legitimately, they could not get an environmental impact statement. Now, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably not the only reason it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen. I heard their costs were too high. With me, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy.\\nYou know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing the old post office or watch (ph) you (ph). I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m under budget, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m ahead of schedule. Hey, look at the campaign. The guy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s at $59 million and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s down at the bottom. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m nothing and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m at the top. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the same thing.\\n I actually said \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s funny. The other day I got this great review. They said trump is a great speaker. The crowd is spellbound. But he has one problem. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m reading, and I want to see. The problem is, he speaks through the Applause. In other words, like I say that, you applaud, I start talking you finish your Applause. And you know why? Because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m so excited, because we have so much potential. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true.\\n I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to wait for your freaking Applause. We have \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I have so many \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we have so much potential. There are so many things to do. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really sort of want to wait. I want to do it. And I just noticed, I did it again. You were getting ready to give a big Applause, because you like that, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m speaking. I killed the Applause. But he is right. But except, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not a speaker. What I am is a doer. I get things done.\\n So, when the people up on the stage with me \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and Hillary, Hillary doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a clue. By the way, you talk about low energy. She has lower energy than Jeb Bush, which is hard to believe. She does. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been saying it. And maybe it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rude, maybe it is not. But it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter. We have a much bigger problem. We have to save our country.\\nSo, if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m rude and if people think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m rude \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m actually a nice person. I have a big heart. I want to help people. I want to help the migration. I want to do a safe zone in Syria. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want them coming here. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know who these people are. They are undocumented.\\n And we should do a safe zone over there. We should have the Gulf states \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Saudi Arabia and these states they are not spending. They have got to spend. They have to pay. You know, we are protecting them. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be there for two minutes if we weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t protecting them. They have to start paying. They are not taking anybody, OK?\\nHow about Germany taking millions of migrants. Can you believe what she is doing to that country? And she was the person of the year and I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. Everybody said Trump was supposed to.\\n(BOOING)\\nHey, what are you going to do. I think she has made a terrible mistake. We will find out. Time will tell. They have tremendous crime problems. I think she has made a tremendous mistake. But what I like is in Syria, with other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s money, meaning the Gulf states and others and Germany and others.\\nBecause, look, Germany is paying a fortune to accept all these people. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll give us the money. We do a massive safe zone. And then eventually when this whole catastrophe straightens out, which I will probably be able to get it straightened out, I understand this now.\\nBut once it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s straightened out, they could go home to their country, you know, to their area. It is interesting, I have thousands of people that work for me. Thousands. And I have people that come from far \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they are all here legally, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry about it. I use E- verify. But I have people \\xe2\\x80\\x94 oh, they go and check. These guys go check.\\nThey went into the old post office checking everybody who walked their dog, are you hear illegally? They said they found one person out of hundreds and hundreds. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it. But, you know, it is possible somebody slipped \\xe2\\x80\\x94 hey, we do have 11 million people in the country. And it is probably a much higher number than that, OK? It is probably a much higher number.\\nBut we have to do something about it and we are going to. So, I just want to finish by saying this. Look, we have a situation that is out of control. Our country is a dumping ground for the rest of the world. We are laughed at by the rest of the world.\\nAnd when I started this journey, and it is a journey, and I do love you people. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re amazing people. And by the way, you are so smart. A lot of times, they will say, well Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s people are blue-collar. I love blue-collar. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m honored by that.\\nBut they are not blue-collar. We have blue-collar and we have executives and we have young people. They say the audience is old. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not older. The audience is young. The other night in Iowa, I told that, and I said, we have so many young people and the place erupted. They are all young people. We have an amazing thing happening, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just...\\n Look, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s their way of marginalizing, not even me, they are marginalizing you. It is disgusting. But when I started this journey and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what it is, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a journey and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a movement that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s taking place. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a movement. Remember the old days? Silent majority? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not right. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a noisy majority. People are angry. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a noisy majority. These aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t silent people anymore. I go to people \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even hear.\\nThis is an amazing thing that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happened. I received a call from one of the biggest reporters, who happens to be liberal, but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s OK. (inaudible) a couple of them, right? But, a guy who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really respected, recently, and he said, \"How does it feel?\" I said, \"How does what feel?\" He said, \"What you have done has never been done in the history of politics in the United States.\" I mean, even CNN said, \"Number one political story of the year is Trump.\" You know what number two was? ISIS \\xe2\\x80\\x94 ISIS was two. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rather reverse it. Let ISIS be one; let me be two, because I want to knock the hell out of them and make me number one next year.\\nMake me number one next year. But this reporter, who is a great intellect, actually, and a very smart guy, very good guy. He said \\xe2\\x80\\x94 he said, \"What you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done has never been done before in the history of this country.\" Newt Gingrich was on a television show the other say, and said, \"This is one the great phenomenons (ph) I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen in politics; nobody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ever seen it.\"\\nCrowds like this? Forget it. I mean, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only confined to this (inaudible). Again, they sent 3,000 people home. Can you believe it? More than 3,000. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unbelievable what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beautiful what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beautiful what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening. But Newt Gingrich said he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s never seen anything like this.\\nBut he said to me, the reporter, he said, \"never been done before.\" I said, \"Well, you know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fine, but if I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just a waste of time.\" He goes, \"No, no, no. What you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done is incredible.\" He said, \"Even if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win, what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done is incredible; you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve totally changed the landscape of politics.\"\\nNo, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t applaud, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t applaud, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t applaud. He said, \"You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve totally changed the landscape of politics; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s forever going to be different. Your campaign \\xe2\\x80\\x94 there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s never been anything like it.\" OK, he was very nice. I said, \"You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand. If I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win, I will consider this\" \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and I mean this \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \"a total and complete waste of time.\" I really do.\\nSo \\xe2\\x80\\x94 because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to do anything. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wonderful. Oh, good, I had nice crowds. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll write about me every once in a while; every two years I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have a story, \"Trump ran this rather good campaign.\" If we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win, to me, and honestly you should feel the same thing, if we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a terrible waste of time, because you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have somebody else in there. They won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be able to do what I do. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to be able to. And even if you get one of these Republicans in, like, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t finish the \\xe2\\x80\\x94 so, the wall.\\nWhen I say \"Mexico is going to pay,\" they all laugh. They all go \"heh, heh, heh.\" They think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s funny. Honestly, these are people \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s funny. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re laughing. You know, lightly, like \"Oh ho, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so funny; ha, ha, ha.\" They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to pay for the wall, folks. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re making billions and billions and billions of dollars on deficits that we have with Mexico. The wall is peanuts. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to pay for the wall.\\nBut I mention it, now they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t laugh because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re starting to agree with me. And then the other day, one of the people said \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it was Ted Cruz, who is a nice guy. But he said, \"We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to build a wall at the southern border.\" I said, \"Look\" \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and my wife is sitting (inaudible) \\xe2\\x80\\x94 where did that come from, right? No, Ted\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good guy.\\nBut he said on one of \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I think it was on Fox, he was being interviewed. And he said, \"We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to build a wall at the southern border.\" He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say Mexico was going to pay was going to pay. He hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t gone that far yet, but believe me that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to happen. See, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all trying to catch up with me. Because when I did this stuff, it was very out there.\\nNow, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the one that everybody wants to sort of aspire to. But what happens is \\xe2\\x80\\x94 so Ted\\xe2\\x80\\x99s up and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talking. And, you know, routinely we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have the border; we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have this and that. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to build a wall.\\nMy wife is sitting there. She says, \"Darling, did you hear that? He just said they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to build a wall. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the first time I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you know, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what you say.\" She hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t heard that from any other candidate.\\nOK. So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to build a wall. Mexico is going to pay for it. There are so many things we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do. But when I \\xe2\\x80\\x94 when I started the journey, it was amazing. I came down \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it took courage. I went down in to the lobby of Trump Tower, on the escalator with Melania. I have never seen \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it looked like the Academy Awards, the press. We have a lot of press here today. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all live \\xe2\\x80\\x94 look at all those live cameras.\\nSo when I came down \\xe2\\x80\\x94 when I came down on the escalator, we came down. And I said, \"We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do things.\" And I mentioned illegal immigration. You wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even be talking about illegal \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even on the radar. Nobody was talking about illegal immigration. Is that right? Now, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the big subjects.\\n And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and one of the beautiful polls that came out, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m so proud of it, CNN just came out with a poll a couple of, I guess a week ago \\xe2\\x80\\x94 36 percent for Trump; second is 16; third is 14; then 12. So they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re way down. But on the economy, they give me 55 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 55 percent. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s with 16 people at the time.\\nOn the budget, I mean, I understand \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the budget, the economy, I win \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I win it hands down, all right.\\nBut listen to this. On illegal immigration, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m almost at 50 percent.\\nAnd on ISIS, likewise, almost at 50 percent. So people want to be protected, they want to feel safe. They need strength, they need toughness, they need smarts. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to be tough \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you know, I know a lot of tough guys but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not smart, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the easiest. You can be tough, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to be smart.\\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s start smart first. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to be smart-tough. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to be tough because the world is trying to take advantage of us. So what happens is this. I came out, I started \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I did it, I was, oh, that first couple of weeks with illegal immigration and Mexico and all of this stuff. Then Kate was killed in San Francisco and Jamiel was killed in Los Angeles. Jamiel Shaw, an unbelievable young man, was killed, just shot right through the head by an illegal immigrant. Kate was shot by a guy who came in five or six times, shot in the back.\\nSo many great people. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x94 these are two, so many. And then you have the economy and the jobs that are being lost and people aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t paying taxes and all of this stuff, right? And all of a sudden, people are coming over, and I say the wall and now they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re starting to say the wall. We have to be progressive in our thinking. When I say progressive, I mean like smart. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not talking progressive like a Bernie Sanders would say, the guy want to tax you. Think of it.\\nThink of it. This guy wants to raise your taxes to 90 percent. No, no, think \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to move out of this \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I love this area, by the way. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been here many times. Great golfing area, right? We love it.\\nNo more golf if Bernie Sanders \\xe2\\x80\\x94 no more golf. No, no, you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any golf anymore. There won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any money left to be \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be paying it in taxes. This guy is a total disaster.\\nAnd I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not saying that \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you why. You know, Hillary said well, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to run against Trump, believe me.\\nThis poor Chuck Todd, Meet the Press. His show is dying and he keeps saying do it, do it, but I never liked it. You know, I just \\xe2\\x80\\x94 he never treated me fairly. So I do his show, he gets the highest ratings he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s had in years. He went from, like \\xe2\\x80\\x94 believe me, I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even give you the numbers, they were massive, the numbers, right? I saved his life, and then he goes Hillary Clinton said that she would most like to run against Donald Trump. And yes \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking forward to it. Trust me, the last person \\xe2\\x80\\x94 she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s already gotten a dose last night, do you agree?\\n She had a tough night. She had a tough one. She had a tough night looking at the beauty pageant, OK?\\nSo Hillary Clinton said \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Chuck Todd \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nice guy. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not trying to knock him. Please don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be insulted, Chuck. But she says she doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like him. But he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t treat me right. So he goes the Clinton campaign said they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d most like to run against Trump, like I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m some kind of a sap. So I call him and I say Chuck, let me explain something. When they say they want to run against me, that means they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to run against me, do you understand that? Do you understand it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reverse psychology.\\nThey say they want to run against me \\xe2\\x80\\x94 first of all, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m winning and tied in the polls now and I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even hit her yet. But look at what happened to all the guys I hit. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re gonzo, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re gone or they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re failing badly, OK, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be gone soon.\\nBut Hillary Clinton \\xe2\\x80\\x94 think of it. I say so Chuck, report it like properly. Trust me, they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to run against Trump. The last thing she wants in her whole life is \\xe2\\x80\\x94 this was only \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I did this in, like, 15 minutes what happened to them, because the husband wants to come and she wants to accuse me of things and the husband\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the great abusers of the world? Give me a break. Give me a break.\\nGive me a break. So the last person she wants to run against is me.\\nNow here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the story. Look, here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the story. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very simple. So I announced \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and I was talking about trade, I was talking about the wall, I was talking about the borders, I was talking about Obamacare, I was talking about the 2nd Amendment will be saved, by the way. The 2nd Amendment.\\nIt will be saved. The 2nd Amendment is going to be with us if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m president. You know, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing everything. They want to get rid of the bullets now, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing everything they can \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nThink of Paris, think of Los Angeles. Think if you had some guns in Paris on the good side, right? They had no guns. Paris has the toughest guns in the world, folks. And France \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I mean, you get caught with a gun, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the only one that has guns are the bad guys. So they go in these various places, they called the guy the mastermind. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a moron. I mean, this guy was a moron. I call him the guy with the dirty hat, right? They got him so good. By the way, the French police did a great job and our Los Angeles police did a phenomenal job. They did a great job.\\nWouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it be wonderful if, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s see, this guy right here in front of me, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a tough guy. This guy with the hat, with the lousy head of hair, but he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a strong-looking guy right here. This guy right there, see? And that one. Wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it be nice if they had a gun on their waist? Somebody. Him, him, him, so that when they \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you know what they were doing in Paris? Get over here, boom. Get over here, boom. Your turn, get over here, boom. One hundred and thirty people with more to follow because there are people that are so badly injured right now in hospitals. Other people are going to die.\\nSame thing over there. These are people that gave a party in honor of their marriage. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something going on, folks. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrong. They gave them a party. They worked \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they gave them a party. She came in on a fiance permit or some nonsense and she was radicalized, and he was probably radicalized by her or he was already radicalized.\\nAnd people knew that they were radicalized and people in the area knew that they had bombs \\xe2\\x80\\x94 who the hell doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know? You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re their next door neighbor. And they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to talk about it. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to report these people. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a real problem. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to report them. No more nonsense.\\nThey didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t report them, and the reason they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t is because they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t disagree with them so much. OK? Believe me. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not because they were afraid. You saw the one who wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t politically correct to (ph) report them. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to report them. I mean, give me a break. So we have to change.\\nSo it started off with me where I was going to talk about trade, I was going to talk about all the things, I was going to talk about the military, building it up. I was going to do all of this, but after Paris and California, and there will be others because they have no fear of us, but after Paris and California, it has totally changed and my poll numbers went up 10 points.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amazing. They went up 10 points. I said, \"What, you think it was the debate?\" Because I did good in the debate. They said, \"No. People view you as a tough cookie that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to take this crap.\" That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what it is.\\nAnd now I talk about protection. I talk about \\xe2\\x80\\x94 trust me. The trade \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so easy for me. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got the greatest guys in the world. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to come in, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do a great job. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do some myself. I always talk about Ford. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to built a plant, $2.5 billion in Mexico. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen with me. That stuff is \\xe2\\x80\\x94 those deals are no good.\\nFord\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leaving. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re closing plants all over Michigan to build a plant in \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in Mexico. How the hell does that help us? OK. Who are the people that think this is a good thing for us? And in the meantime, in Michigan and other places, we have plants closing all over the place and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re spending \\xe2\\x80\\x94 think about a $2.5 billion \\xe2\\x80\\x94 then they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to sell cars, trucks and parts into the United States, no tax, no nothing.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to pay a tax, folks. And you know what? Ford will say \"If I (inaudible) pay a tax, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to stay in the United States.\" I mean, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very simple.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very simple. How about two weeks ago, Nabisco announced a big \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Chicago. They announced they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to leave Chicago with one of their big plants and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to move it to Mexico. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my statement? We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not eating oreos anymore, right? No more.\\nBut I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want this. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen. Then they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re make \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make product and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to sell it into the United States? Not going to happen. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen. And by the way, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a free trader. I believe \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to be smart. I mean, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to get something. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get anything out of anything. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get anything.\\nWe lose on everything. That Iran deal was a disaster. By the way, think of the Iran deal for one second. I always \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and this came to me two weeks ago. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know why I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think of it sooner. Very disappointed with myself.\\nThe Iran deal is the worst deal I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen negotiated, OK? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m wrong. You know what the worst deal is? Iran\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a part of that one too. We gave them Iraq. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s even better. Think of it. We gave Iran Iraq. Iran has the biggest \\xe2\\x80\\x94 think of it. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have the richest oil \\xe2\\x80\\x94 if you go to Iraq, take a look. Among the largest oil reserves in the world.\\nWe gave them, by decapitating Iraq and then leaving, because frankly, once we did it we should have kept 20,00 troops or something, we give Iraq. So not only did they make a great deal in terms of the Iran deal that we know having to do with nuclear, we also gave them Iraq. We gave them Iraq, that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been after for 100 years. We handed it to them.\\nSo now, they have the largest oil reserves among \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in the world. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s even better than the original deal. I mean, whoever is representing Iran is doing a hell of a job. OK? If that was a stock, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to buy some.\\nSo we are not going to have deals like that with me. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to become rich again, we are going to become safe again and we are going to become strong again. And...\\nAnd you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to remember this moment. This is going to be an important moment for all of us. The one thing I have to say and I have to ask you to do, go out and vote. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be your turn.\\nNumber three. Remember, it starts on February 1st with Iowa. We go to New Hampshire, then we go to the finals (ph), so three weeks. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got four weeks to go, and then we have three weeks after we start. No matter what is going on in your life, you have got to out and vote. Because if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen.\\nDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sit back and say, oh, Trump is going to do well. The more we can win by, you know, the more power we have in a sense, because it is like a mandate. But you have got to go out and vote. And I will tell you this. It has been an honor to be here, I love this area, I love the people here. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been an honor.\\nBut we will make America great again, I promise. Thank you.\\n (OFF-MIKE) Thank you very much, everybody. Well, I want to begin by thanking the people of South Carolina. This is a special state. Thank you. These are special people and we got a little boost last week from a place we all remember -- New Hampshire. We can\\'t forget it. Special, special. We love it. And they sent us in here with a very good feeling, right?\\n Very good feeling. So I really want to thank you and my volunteers. All of these people -- volunteers and they travel and they -- and I say, \"what are you doing?\" And now they\\'re going to Texas and they\\'re going all over. Some are going to Nevada. I\\'ll be going to Nevada. We\\'re making a big speech tomorrow in Atlanta and then we\\'re going right to Nevada.\\nAnd I think we\\'re going to do terrific and the SEC\\'s (ph) going to be very, very exciting. We expect to do very, very well. Very well ...\\n I want to just say thank you to my family. It\\'s been not easy for them. They don\\'t see me anymore. I\\'m making speeches all the time and I have a great. I really have a great family so I just want to thank all of you.\\nAnd Ivanka -- you know we have a hospital ready just in case. In South Carolina we\\'re going to have a baby. There\\'s nothing wrong with that, right? So ...\\n Could be -- it could be any second. It could even be before I\\'m finished but it\\'s -- but she insisted on being here. It was so important to Ivanka to insist on being here so thank you. Really good and Jared, Vanessa, Don.\\nWe have a wonderful lieutenant governor who backed us very early in the process.\\n You know Henry, right? The lieutenant governor of South Carolina. I will take him over the governor anytime because we won. We won ...\\n He handle that very nicely. He\\'s tough. He\\'s very tough. Tiffany, Eric, Lara and Melania. Melania, say something. Go ahead, please ...\\nM. TRUMP: Just want to say an amazing place -- South Carolina. Congratulation to my husband. He was working very hard and he loves you. We love you and we\\'re going ahead to Nevada. And we will see what happen (sic). He would be the best president ...\\n And representing some very, very wonderful children, Ivanka. Just say a few words.\\nI. TRUMP: Thank you, South Carolina. This is an amazing, amazing night. The momentum since the beginning of this campaign has been unbelievable and that\\'s because my father\\'s message resonants so deeply with so many people. So as our family we\\'re incredibly proud. We\\'re incredibly grateful to each of you so thank you for being here to support us. And I will say this, my father is an incredibly hard worker and he\\'ll be working for each and every one of you. So together we\\'ll make America great again. Thank you ...\\n Thank you very much. Thank you very much. So I was watching upstairs and it was really amazing to be watching what I was watching. And some of the pundits and overall fair but not too much. But a number of the pundits said, \"well, if a couple of the other candidates dropped out if you add their scores together it\\'s going to equal Trump.\"\\nBut these geniuses -- they\\'re geniuses -- they don\\'t understand that as people drop out I\\'m going to get a lot of those votes also. You don\\'t just ...\\n You don\\'t just add them together. So I think we\\'re going to do very, very well. I think we\\'re going to do very well. I want to also congratulate the other candidates. In particular I have to say Ted and Marco did a really good job and they got -- they did quite well as I understand. No, come on. Just one minute. Come on. One second, right? Good.\\nOK. We go back to war tomorrow morning. Tomorrow morning we\\'ll be back but I just want to congratulate the other candidates. There\\'s nothing easy about running for president, I can tell you. It\\'s tough, it\\'s nasty, it\\'s mean, it\\'s vicious, it\\'s beautiful.\\n(LAUGHTER)\\n When you win it\\'s beautiful and we\\'re going to start -- we are going to start winning for our country. We\\'re going to start winning.\\n Because our country doesn\\'t win anymore. Doesn\\'t win. We don\\'t win with the military, we can\\'t beat ISIS. We have great military but we can\\'t beat ISIS. We don\\'t win on trade. You look at what China\\'s doing to us, what Japan does to us, what Mexico is just killing us at the border -- at the border and with trade. Mexico is killing us -- absolutely. We\\'ll do the wall. Don\\'t worry. We\\'re going to do the wall.\\n  We\\'re going to do the wall and by the way, who\\'s going to pay for the wall?\\n Mexico\\'s going to pay for the wall and it\\'s very easy. The other politicians come down, \"you can\\'t get Mexico to pay for the wall.\" I said, \"100 percent.\" We have a $58 billion trade deficit with Mexico. The wall is going to cost $10 to $12 billion, OK? Believe me, they will pay. One of the officials -- actually, one of the ex-officials from Mexico had a news conference.\\nAnd he announced that we will not be paying for the wall. Who does Mr. Trump think he is? They came to me -- the press. These people -- look at all those cameras back there.\\n The press came to me and they told me that he said that he would not pay for the wall. Do you have a comment? I said, \"yes. The wall just got 10 feet taller.\"\\n It\\'s true. And I love Mexico. I love Mexico, I love China, I love many of these countries that rip us off because we have leaders that are incomptent and don\\'t know what they\\'re doing. I love these countries. They\\'re great. I have thousands and thousands of Hispanics. We\\'re going to Nevada.\\nI lead -- I lead with the Hispanics. I\\'m leading in every poll with the Hispanics. They love me, I love them. The problem is -- the problem is that the leaders of these countries whether it\\'s Mexico or Japan or Viet Nam which is just doing a big number now all of a sudden or China in particular -- that\\'s the big one. The greatest abuse of a country that I think I\\'ve ever seen financially -- China.\\nWhat they\\'ve done to us is the greatest single theft in the history of the world. They\\'ve taken our jobs, they\\'ve taken our money, they\\'ve taken everything. We\\'re bringing our jobs back, folks. We\\'re bringing our jobs back. We\\'re going to bring them back ...\\n And I know how to do it. We\\'ve had so many -- we\\'ve had so many incredible endorsements and to me getting the greatest business people to endorse me is very important. Carl Icahn endorsed me, so many others have endorsed me.\\nAnd we\\'re going to put these great business people in charge of trade and when China wants to come and negotiate, they\\'re going to negotiate not with a political hack which is what they have now. They\\'re going to negotiate with the best business minds in the world and we have them in this country.\\n  So we\\'re going to do a lot of beautiful work. We\\'re going to terminate Obamacare. It\\'s going to terminated. It\\'s going to be over ...\\n It\\'s going to be repealed and it\\'s going to be replaced. And you\\'re going to have much better health care at a much smaller cost because Obamacare -- if you look -- look at the increases in your Obamacare. Twenty-five, 35, 45, even 55 percent. It\\'s dead. It\\'s not working. We\\'re going to go to a plan that\\'s going to be so much better and so much less expensive.\\n So second amendment by the way -- this is a room loves the second amendment. Thank you, fellows. This is a room loves and cherishes the second amendment. We are going to protect our second amendment. Totally ...\\n Common core is gone. We are getting rid of common core. We\\'re brining education to a local level. The people in this community -- every time I see them they want education locally. The parents, the teachers. They want to do it -- they don\\'t want bureaucrats in Washington telling them how to educate their children.\\n We spend as a nation more for education per pupil than any other nation in the world. Not even close. More per pupil -- second place doesn\\'t even exist it\\'s so different. And yet out of 30 countries we\\'re ranked number 30. You have China, you have Norway, Swenden, Denmark and then you have number 30, the United States. So we spend the most and we\\'re at the bottom of the heap. It\\'s not going to happen anymore, folks. It\\'s not going to happen anymore.\\n We are going to build our military which I thank because a number of the people came down and a number of the pundits in Washington I -- we love our military.\\n We love our military. And by the way we love our police. Our police are terrific. We love our police ...\\n They are not being treated properly. We\\'re going to build our military so big, so good, so strong, so powerful that nobody is ever going to mess with us, folks.\\n  And we\\'re going to buy -- we\\'re going to buy the equipment that our generals, our soldiers, that everybody that\\'s in the know want. We\\'re not buying equipment that sells because they have political pull (ph). Because they take campaign and they give campaign contributions.\\nWe are going to get the equipment that they want, not the equipment that they\\'re told to have by senators and congressmen in Washington. We\\'re going to have great equipment.\\n And the reason I can say that is I\\'m self-funding my campaign. I\\'m not getting millions of dollars from all of these ...\\n I\\'m not getting millions of dollars from all of these special interests and lobbyists and donors that once they get it they literally do whatever the politicians want. That\\'s not going to happen. And we\\'re going to take care of our vets. We love our vets and they\\'re being treated terribly. We\\'re taking care of our vets.\\n So we\\'re now off to Nevada and it\\'s a great state. We have great people. We have great people in our nation. No matter where we go -- I went to Mobile, Alabama -- 35,000 people. We went to Oklahoma recently twice -- 20,000 people, 20,000 people. No matter where we go we fill up the arenas.\\nOver here the other day we had a 9,000 -- we had a 10,000 -- we have people. The only thing that stops the crowds are the walls because we can\\'t get them in. We have to send thousands of people away.\\nTime Magazine -- Time Magazine last year did an incredible cover story. They said \"it\\'s a movement.\" And that\\'s what it is. It\\'s an incredible movement with incredible people. Incredible people.\\n It\\'s an incredible movement with incredible people. I tell you. And whether we go -- honestly whether we go to Dallas or whether we go anywhere you say -- you go to L.A. -- you go anywhere you say. Our people are incredible. And our theme -- what\\'s our theme? You know it, right?\\n Our theme which I love may be the greatest theme of all time, right? And the word again eventually is going to come off. We\\'re going to get rid of the whole theme because what\\'s going to happen -- make America great again, right?\\nAnd the last two weeks because I\\'ve gotten to see so many -- I guess millions when you add them all up with all of these rooms and all of these speeches. And I\\'ve met so many people. But the people are so incredible that I\\'ve been saying make America great again and it\\'s going to be greater than ever before. That\\'s the kind of potential we have. Greater then every before.\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see how there is any room for misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the statement I made on June 16th during my Presidential announcement speech. Here is what I said, and yet this statement is deliberately distorted by the media:\\n\"When Mexico (meaning the Mexican Government) sends its people, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not sending their best. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not sending you (pointing to the audience). They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not sending you (pointing again). They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sending people that have lots of problems, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re bringing those problems to us. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re bringing drugs.They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re bringing crime. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people! But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting. And it only makes common sense. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sending us not the right people. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming from more than Mexico. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming from all over South and Latin America, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming probably from the Middle East. But we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to stop and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to stop fast.\"\\nWhat can be simpler or more accurately stated? The Mexican Government is forcing their most unwanted people into the United States. They are, in many cases, criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc. This was evident just this week when, as an example, a young woman in San Francisco was viciously killed by a 5 time deported Mexican with a long criminal record, who was forced back into the United States because they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want him in Mexico. This is merely one of thousands of similar incidents throughout the United States. In other words, the worst elements in Mexico are being pushed into the United States by the Mexican\\ngovernment. The largest suppliers of heroin, cocaine and other illicit drugs are Mexican cartels that arrange to have Mexican immigrants trying to cross the borders and smuggle in the drugs. The Border Patrol knows this. Likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border. The United States has become a dumping ground for Mexico and, in fact, for many other parts of the world. On the other hand, many fabulous people come in from Mexico and our country is better for it. But these people are here legally, and are severely hurt by those coming in illegally. I am proud to say that I know many hard working Mexicans\\xe2\\x80\\x94many of them are working for and with me...and, just like our country, my organization is better for it.\\nThe Mexican Government wants an open border as long as it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a ONE WAY open border into the United States. Not only are they killing us at the border, but they are killing us on trade ... and the country of Mexico is making billions of dollars in doing so.\\nI have great respect for Mexico and love their people and their peoples\\xe2\\x80\\x99 great spirit. The problem is, however, that their leaders are far smarter, more cunning, and better negotiators than ours. To the citizens of the United States, who I will represent far better than anyone else as President, the Mexican government is not our friend...and why should they be when the relationship is totally one sided in their favor on both illegal immigration and trade. I have pointed this out during my speeches and it is something Mexico doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want me to say. In actuality, it was only after my significant rise in the polls that Univision, previously my friend, went ballistic. I believe that my examples of bad trade deals for the United States was of even more concern to the Mexican government than my talk of border security.\\nI have lost a lot during this Presidential run defending the people of the United States. I have always heard that it is very hard for a successful person to run for President. Macy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, NBC, Serta and NASCAR have all taken the weak and very sad position of being politically correct even though they are wrong in terms of what is good for our country. Univision, because 70% of their business comes from Mexico, in my opinion, is being dictated to by the Mexican Government. The last thing Mexico wants is Donald Trump as President in that I will make great trade deals for the United States and will have an impenetrable border--only legally approved people will come through easily.\\nInterestingly, Univision has just announced they are attempting to go public despite very poor and even negative earnings, which is not a good situation for a successful IPO or high stock price\\xe2\\x80\\x94not to mention that I am currently suing them for breach of contract. Remember, Univision is the one who began this charade in the first place, and they are owned by one of Hillary Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s biggest backers. After the speech was made, there were numerous compliments and indeed, many rave \"reviews\"\\xe2\\x80\\x94there was very little criticism. It wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t until a week after my announcement that people started to totally distort these very easy to understand words. If there was something stated incorrectly, it would have been brought up immediately and with great enthusiasm.\\nThe issues I have addressed, and continue to address, are vital steps to Make America Great Again! Additionally, I would be the best jobs President that God ever created. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s get to work!\\nTRUMP: (OFF-MIKE) This was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and all of the bad things and we all know what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on, and especially how poor she\\xe2\\x80\\x99d do as president in these very, very troubled times of radical Islamic terrorism.\\nTRUMP: Even her former Secret Service agent, who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be our president. There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will deliver that speech very, very soon.\\nBut today, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only one thing to discuss, the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders. The attack on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was the worst terror strike on our soil since September 11th, and the worst mass shooting in our country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history.\\nSo many people \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just hard to believe, but just so many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace. The horror is beyond description. The families of these wonderful people are totally devastated, and they will be forever. Likewise, our whole nation and indeed the whole world is devastated.\\nWe express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families. We mourn as one people for our nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loss, and pledge our support to any and all who need it. I would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of this attack.\\nThank you. Our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlando\\xe2\\x80\\x99s LGBT community. They have been through something that nobody could ever experience. This is a very dark moment in America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history. A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub, not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens, because of their sexual orientation.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want, and express their identity. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country.\\nWe need to respond to this attack on America as one united people, with force, purpose, and determination. But the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and to think and act clearly. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not acting clearly, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not talking clearly, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got problems.\\nIf we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get tough, and if we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get smart, and fast, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to have our country anymore. There will be nothing, absolutely nothing, left. The killer, whose name I will not use, or ever say, was born in Afghan, of Afghan parents, who immigrated to the United States.\\nHis father published support for the Afghan Taliban, a regime which murders those who don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t share its radical views, and they murdered plenty. The father even said he was running for president of Afghanistan. The bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place, was because we allowed his family to come here.\\nThat is a fact, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a fact we need to talk about. We have a dysfunctional immigration system, which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens properly. We have an incompetent administration.\\nAnd if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m elected president, that will not change, I will tell you, that will not change over the next four years. We have an administration that will not change. But if I get in there, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to change, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to change quickly. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going from totally incompetent to just the opposite, believe me.\\nTRUMP: Thank you.\\nWith 50 people dead and perhaps more ultimately and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around issues anymore. We have to address these issues head-on. I called for a ban after San Bernardino and was met with great scorn and anger but now many years and I have to say many years but many are saying that I was right to do so. And although the pause is temporary we must find out what is going on. We have to do it.\\nIt will be lifted \\xe2\\x80\\x94 this ban \\xe2\\x80\\x94 when and as a nation we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in a position to properly and perfectly screen these people coming into our country. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re pouring in and we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing. The immigration laws of the United States give the president powers to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons. Now, any class \\xe2\\x80\\x94 it really is determined and to be determined by the president for the interests of the United States. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s as he or she deems appropriate. Hopefully it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s he in this case.\\nThank you. I will use this power to protect the American people. When I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m elected I will suspend immigration from areas of the world where there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats. After a full \\n\\nThank you.\\nAnd by the way we have no choice. After a full and partial and long \\xe2\\x80\\x94 really long overdue security assessment we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of America.\\nWe cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer. Many of the principles of radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions.\\n Remember this, radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti- American.\\nI refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, Jewish people are targets of persecution and intimation by radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence.\\nThis is not just a national security issue. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a quality of life issue. If we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans \\xe2\\x80\\x94 women and children, gay and straight, Jews and Christians and all people then we need to tell the truth about radical Islam and we need to do it now.\\nWe need to tell the truth also about how radical Islam is coming to our shores. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming ...\\nWith these people, folks, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re importing radical Islamic terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system and through an intelligence community held back by our president. Even our own FBI director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of people we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re letting into America. All of the September 11th hijackists were issued visas. Large numbers of Somali refugees in Minnesota have tried to join ISIS.\\nThe Boston bombers came here through political asylum. The male shooter in San Bernardino again whose name I will not mention was the child of immigrants from Pakistan and he brought his wife, the other terrorist from Saudi Arabia through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.\\nTRUMP: Immigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five fold \\xe2\\x80\\x94 five fold in just one year. According to Pew Research, 99 percent of the people in Afghanistan support oppressive sharia law. We admit many more, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just the way it is. We admit many more from other countries in the region.\\nAnd I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what: They share these oppressive views and values. We want to remain a free and open society. Then, and if we do, then we have to control our borders. We have to control, and we have to control them now, not later. Right now.\\nThank you.\\nYet Hillary Clinton, for months, and despite so many attacks, repeatedly refused to even say the words radical Islam until I challenged her yesterday. And, guess what, she will probably say them. She sort of has said them, but let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s see what happens. She really has no choice, but she doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to.\\nHowever, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really been forced, and she has been forced to say these words. She supports, and the reason is, she supports so much of what is wrong, and what is wrong with this country, and what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going wrong with our country and our borders. She has no clue, in my opinion, what radical Islam is and she won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t speak honestly about it if she does, in fact, know. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the entire world \\xe2\\x80\\x94 true weakness.\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if you know this, but just a few weeks before San Bernardino, the slaughter, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all it was was a slaughter, Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words \"radical Islam.\" Here is what she said, exact quote, \"Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.\" That is Hillary Clinton.\\nSo, she says the solution is to ban guns. They tried that in France which has among the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world, and 130 people were brutally murdered by Islamic terrorists in cold blood. Her plan is to disarm law abiding Americans, abolishing the Second Amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns. No good. Not going to happen, folks. Not going to happen. Not going to happen.\\nThank you.\\nShe wants to take away American\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guns and then admit the very people who want to slaughter us. Let them come into the country, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have guns. Let them come in, let them have all the fun they want.\\nI will be meeting with the NRA, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a presidential race, to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror. I will be always defending the Second Amendment.\\nThank you. Thank you.\\nThe bottom line is that Hillary supports policies that bring the threat of radical Islam into American and allow it to grow oversees, and it is growing. In fact, Hillary Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more radical Islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our society but our entire way of life. When it comes to radical Islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deadly \\xe2\\x80\\x94 totally deadly.\\nThe Obama administration, with the support of Hillary Clinton and others, has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence gathering and we have, just, no intelligence gathering information. We need this information so badly, and he stopped it. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the support. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the support of the law enforcement system because Obama is not letting them do their job. They are not being allowed to do their job. And, they can do it well \\xe2\\x80\\x94 better than anybody.\\nWe need a new leader. We need a new leader fast.\\nTRUMP: Thank you.\\nThey have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else. I refuse to be politically correct.\\nI want to do the right thing. I want to straighten things out and I want to make America great again.\\nThe days of deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m elected. As president I will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have those tools now.\\nWe need an intelligence gathering system second to none. Second to none. That includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials, and with our allies, very importantly. I will have an Attorney General, a Director of National Intelligence and a Secretary of Defense who\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll know how to fight a war on radical Islamic terrorism.\\nAnd they will have the support that they need to get the job done right, not like it is right now. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not right.\\nWe also must ensure the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat. The Senate subcommittee on Immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the United States since September 11th. Nearly a year ago, the Senate Subcommittee asked President Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Department of Justice, State and Homeland Security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the United States. These Departments refused to comply. Nobody even knows why. They refused to comply.\\nPresident Obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activities of any kind since September 11th. So important. The public has a right to know how these people got here, how they came on to this great land, why are they here?\\nWe have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with or supporting radical groups and beliefs, very simple. We have to control the amount of future immigration into this country and we have to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside America. Not complicated.\\nEvery \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and just think of this. Take a look. Every single event, even a single individual can be devastating, and all you have to do is take a look at what happened in Orlando and what happened in other cases. Just a single event. And just one person. Can you imagine what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do in large groups, which we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re allowing now to come here.\\nTruly our President doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s doing. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s failed us and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s failed us badly. Under his leadership this situation will not get any better, it will only get worse. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been saying that for a long time. Each year the United States permanently admits 100,000 immigrants from the Middle East and many more from Muslim countries outside of the Middle East. Our government has been admitting ever- growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our own security.\\nIn fact, Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s State Department was in charge of admissions and the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas. Having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan including a 500 percent increase in Syrian refugees coming into our country. Tell me, tell me \\xe2\\x80\\x93 how stupid is that?\\nThis could be a better, bigger, more horrible version than the legendary Trojan Horse ever was. Altogether, under the Clinton plan, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of the children and their children. Not only their children, by the way, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re trying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful ISIS is and how wonderful Islam is and we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening.\\nTRUMP: The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to really to screen. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not screening people.\\nSo why don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we have an effective screening system? We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re being laughed at all over the world. The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans. The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us how she will pay for it, her plan will cost hundreds of billions of dollars long term.\\nWouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t this be money better spent rebuilding America for our current population including the many poor people already living here. We have cities, we have inner cities...\\nWe have poverty all over and this is how we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re spending billions of dollars. We have to stop the tremendous flow of Syrian refugees into the United States. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know who they are, they have no documentation and we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re planning and we won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t unless we have proper supervisor and proper leadership in which case they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re out of here. What I want...What I want is common sense. I want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a choice I put before the American people. A mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit America or Hillary Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically correct special interests. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all it is. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to get smart and tough and vigilant and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to do it now because later is too late \\xe2\\x80\\x94 going to be too late for our country.\\nThe media talks about home grown terrorism but Islamic radicalism and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very, very important term \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a term that the president refuses to use and the networks that nurture it are imports from overseas whether you like it or whether you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like it. Yes, there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of poor policies of the past.\\nBut the whole point is that we will be much, much and it will be easier to deal with our current problem if we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t keep on bringing people who add to the problem. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re letting all of these people \\xe2\\x80\\x94 hundreds of thousands of people come in and all they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing is adding to this incredible problem we have.\\nFor instance, the controversial mosque attended by the Boston bombers had at its founder and as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot. This shooter and amazingly in Orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on earth. Why would we admit people who support violent hatred?\\nHillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists to our country and who suppress women, gays and anyone who doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t share their views or values.\\nShe can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have it both ways. She can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to oppress these same communities. How does this kind of immigration make our lives better? How does this kind of immigration make our country better? Why does Hillary Clinton want to bring people in in vast numbers who reject our values? Why? Explain.\\nAsk yourself who is really the friend of women and the LGBT community, Donald Trump with actions or Hillary Clinton with her words?\\nTRUMP: I will tell you who the better friend is and some day I believe that will be proven out bigly (ph).\\nAnd by the way the LGBT community is just \\xe2\\x80\\x94 what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happened to them is just so sad and to be thinking about where their policies are currently with this administration is a disgrace to that community, I will tell you right now.\\nClinton wants to allow radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country. They enslave women, and they murder gays. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want them in our country.\\nImmigration is a privilege, and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t support our communities. All of our communities, every single one of them. Americans already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on Earth, anybody in the world. Four times more. At least, because we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming in. And we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny.\\nNot surprisingly, wages for our workers haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t budged. In almost 20 years. You wonder why we get the crowds, you wonder why we get this tremendous support, you wonder why I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gotten more votes than any Republican in any primary in the history of the Republican Party? Take a look at that. Take a look at your security, take a look at the wages. For 18 years they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been stagnant, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve even gone down.\\nSo whether it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a matter of national security, or financial security, we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t afford to keep on going like this. Cannot afford it. We owe $19 trillion in debt. And no longer have any options. Our communities from all backgrounds are ready for some relief. This is not an act of offense against anyone. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really an act of defense. I want us all, all of us, to work together. We have to form a partnership, with our Muslim communities. We have Muslim communities in this country that are great, and we have to form that partnership.\\nNow, the Muslim community, so important. They have to work with us. They have to cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad. They know it. And they have to do it, and they have to do it forthwith. I want to fix our schools. I want to fix our bridges. And our jobs market, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have it rocket again, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make great trade deals. But I want every American to succeed including Muslims.\\nBut the Muslims have to work with us. They have to work with us. They know what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on. They know that he was bad. They knew the people in San Bernardino were bad. But you know what? They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t turn them in. And you know what? We had death, and destruction.\\nHillary Clinton wants to empty out the Treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our citizens. I want to protect our citizens, all of our citizens. The terrorist attack on Pulse nightclub demands a full and complete investigation into every single aspect of the assault. In San Bernardino, as an example, people who knew what was going on, they knew exactly, but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it. They said oh, \"We thought so but we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to use racial profiling.\" Which was probably an excuse given to them by their lawyer, so they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get in trouble.\\nWe need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives, parents, friends and associates. We need to know if he was affiliated with any radical mosques or radical activists and what, if any, is their immigration status. We have to know, and we have to know fast. We need to know if he traveled anywhere and who he traveled with. We need to know, and we need to make sure, every single last person involved in this plan, including anyone who knew something but didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell us, is brought to justice, so when people know what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on and they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell us, and we have an attack, and people die, these people have to have consequences. Big consequences.\\nAmerica must do more \\xe2\\x80\\x94 much more \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to protect its citizens, especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientation, as you just saw in Orlando.\\nTRUMP: It also means we must change our foreign policy. The decision to overthrow the regime in Libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in Syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for ISIS to expand and grow like nobody has ever seen before.\\nThese actions, along with our disastrous Iran deal, have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our Muslim allies in the region. That is why our new goal must be to defeat Islamic terrorism not nation building. No more nation building. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s never going to work.\\nAnd by the way we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve spent almost $5 trillion over the years on trying to nation build in the Middle East and it has been complete and total disaster. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re further away now than we were 15 years ago. For instance, the last major NATO mission was Hillary Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s war in Libya. That mission helped to unleash ISIS on a new continent.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve said NATO need to change its focus and stop terrorism. We have to focus on terrorism and we have to stop terrorism. Since I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve raised that criticism and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s OK. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gotten no credit for it but these are minor details \\xe2\\x80\\x94 NATO has since announced a new initiative \\xe2\\x80\\x94 front page of the Wall Street Journal four days ago focused on just that. America must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against Islamic terrorism.\\nPretty much like we did with communism during the Cold War. We tried it President Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s way, doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work. He gave the world his apology tour. We got ISIS and many other problems in return. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we got. Remember the famous apology tour. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sorry for everything.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solitarily with the people of Orlando who have come under this horrific attack. When I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m president I pledge to protect and defend all Americans who live inside our borders. Wherever they come from, wherever they were born, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care. All Americans living here and following our laws not other laws will be protected.\\nThank you. Thank you. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be tough and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be smart and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do it right. America will be a tolerant and open society. America will also be a safe society. We will protect our borders at home. We will defeat ISIS overseas. We have no choice. We will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety. We will make America rich again. We will make America safe again. We will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.\\nThank you. Thank you very much, everybody. Appreciate it. Thank you.\\nGood evening. Thank you very much. I speak to you today as a lifelong supporter and true friend of Israel. I am a newcomer to politics but not to backing the Jewish state.\\nIn late 2001, weeks after the attacks on New York City, and on Washington, and frankly the attacks on all of us, attacks that perpetrated... and they were perpetrated by the Islamic fundamentalists, Mayor Rudy Giuliani visited Israel to show solidarity with terror victims. I sent my plane because I backed the mission for Israel 100 percent.\\nIn Spring of 2004, at the height of the violence in the Gaza Strip, I was the Grand Marshal of the 40th Salute to Israel Parade, the largest single gathering in support of the Jewish state. It was a very dangerous time for Israel and frankly for anyone supporting Israel, many people turned down this honor. I did not. I took the risk and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m glad I did.\\nBut I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come here tonight to pander to you about Israel. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what politicians do. All talk, no action, believe me. I came here to speak to you about where I stand on the future of American relations with our strategic ally, our unbreakable friendship, and our cultural brother. The only democracy in the Middle East, the State of Israel.\\nMy number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran. I have been in business a long time. I know deal-making and let me tell you, this deal is catastrophic, for America, for Israel, and for the whole of the Middle East.\\nThe problem here is fundamental. We have rewarded the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leading state sponsor of terror with $150 billion dollars, and we received absolutely nothing in return.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve studied this issue in great detail. I would say actually, greater by far than anybody else. Believe me, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bad deal. The biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that Iran is going to violate it, because already, as you know, it has. The bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock. And of course, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll keep the billions and billions of dollars that we so stupidly and foolishly gave them.\\nThe deal doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even require Iran to dismantle its military nuclear capability. Yes, it places limits on its military nuclear program for only a certain number of years. But when those restrictions expire, Iran will have an industrial size military nuclear capability ready to go, and with zero provision for delay, no matter how bad Iran\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behavior is. Terrible, terrible situation that we are all placed in, and especially Israel.\\nWhen I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m president, I will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to Iran. First, we will stand up to Iran\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region. Iran is a very big problem and will continue to be, but if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not elected President, I know how to deal with trouble, and believe me, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to be elected president folks. And we are leading in every poll, remember that please.\\nIran is a problem in Iraq, a problem in Syria, a problem in Lebanon, a problem in Yemen, and will be a very, very major problem for Saudi Arabia. Literally every day, Iran provides more and better weapons to support their puppet states. Hezbollah, Lebanon received, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what, it has received sophisticated anti-ship weapons, anti-aircraft weapons, and GPS systems and rockets. like very few people anywhere in the world, and certainly very few countries have.\\nNow they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in Syria trying to establish another front against Israel from the Syrian side of the Golan Heights. In Gaza, Iran is supporting Hamas and Islamic Jihad. And in the West Bank they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re openly offering Palestinians $7,000 per terror attack and $30,000 for every Palestinian terrorist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s home that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been destroyed. A deplorable, deplorable situation. Iran is financing military forces throughout the Middle East, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s absolutely incredible that we handed them over $150 billion to do even more toward the many horrible acts of terror.\\nSecondly, we will totally dismantle Iran\\xe2\\x80\\x99s global terror network, which is big and powerful, but not powerful like us. Iran has seeded terror groups all over the world. During the last five years, Iran has perpetrated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got terror cells everywhere, including in the western hemisphere very close to home. Iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world and we will work to dismantle that reach, believe me, believe me.\\nThird, at the very least, we must enforce the terms of the previous deal, to hold Iran totally accountable. And we will enforce it like you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never seen a contract enforced before folks. Believe me.\\nIran has already since the deal is in place, test-fired ballistic missiles three times. Those ballistic missiles with a range of 1,250 miles were designed to intimidate not only Israel, which is only 600 miles away, but also intended to frighten Europe, and maybe someday hit even the United States. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to let that happen. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not letting it happen, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not letting it happen to Israel, believe me.\\nDo you want to hear something really shocking? As many of the great people in this room know, painted on those missiles in both Hebrew and Farsi, were the words \"Israel must be wiped off the face of the earth.\" You can forget that!\\nWhat kind of demented minds write that in Hebrew? And here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, you talk about twisted, here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s another twisted part: testing these missiles does not even violate the horrible deal that we made! The deal is silent on test missiles, but those tests do violate United Nations Security Council resolutions. The problem is, no one has done anything about it. We will, we will, I promise we will.\\nWhich brings me to my next point. The utter weakness and incompetence of the United Nations. The United Nations is not a friend of democracy. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a friend to freedom. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a friend even to the United States of America, where as you know, it has its home. And it surely is not a friend to Israel.\\nWith President Obama in his final year, yay! He may be the worst thing to ever happen to Israel, believe me. Believe me, and you know it, and you know it better than anybody.\\nSo with the president in his final year, discussions have been swirling about an attempt to bring a Security Council resolution on terms of an eventual agreement between Israel and Palestine. Let me be clear. An agreement imposed by the United Nations would be a total and complete disaster. The United States must oppose this resolution and use the power of our veto, which I will use as president, 100 percent.\\nWhen people ask why, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not how you make a deal. Deals are made when parties come together. They come to a table and they negotiate. Each side must give up something it values, I mean we have to do something where there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s value in exchange for something that it requires. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what a deal is. A deal is really something that when we impose it on Israel and Palestine, we bring together a group of people that come up with something. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen with the United Nations. It will only further, very importantly, it will only further delegitimize Israel. It will be a catastrophe and a disaster for Israel. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen folks.\\nAnd further, it would reward Palestinian terrorism, because every day they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re stabbing Israelis, and even Americans. Just last week, American Taylor Allen Force, a West Point grad, phenomenol young person who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, was murdered in the street by a knife-wielding Palestinian. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t reward behavior like that. You can not do it! There is only one way you treat that kind of behavior. You have to confront it!\\nSo, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not up the United Nations to go with a solution. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really the parties that must negotiate a resolution themselves. You have no choice. They have to do it themselves, or it will never hold up anyway. The United States can be useful as a facilitator of negotiations, but no one should be telling Israel that it must abide by some agreement made by others thousands of miles away that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even really know what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening to Israel, to anything in the area. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so preposterous. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to let that happen. When I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m president, believe me, I will veto any attempt by the UN to impose its will on the Jewish state. It will be vetoed 100 percent.\\nYou see, I know about deal-making. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I do. I wrote \\xe2\\x80\\x98The Art of the Deal\\xe2\\x80\\x99. One of the best-selling, all-time, and I mean seriously, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m saying \\xe2\\x80\\x98one of\\xe2\\x80\\x99, because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be criticized as though I say \\xe2\\x80\\x98the\\xe2\\x80\\x99, so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to be very diplomatic. One of... I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be criticized. I think it is number one, but why take a chance. One of the best-selling, all-time books about deals and deal making.\\nTo make a great deal, you need two willing participants. We know Israel is willing to deal. Israel has been trying to sit down at the negotiating table without pre-conditions for years. You had Camp David in 2000, where Prime Minister Barak made an incredible offer, maybe even too generous. Arafat rejected it. In 2008, Prime Minister Olmert made an equally generous offer. The Palestinian Authority rejected it also. Then John Kerry tried to come up with a framework and Abbas didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even respond, not even to the Secretary of State of the United States of America. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even respond.\\nWhen I become President, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on Day One. And when I say something, I mean it. I mean it. I will meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu immediately. I have known him for many years and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be able to work closely together to help bring stability and peace to Israel and to the entire region.\\nMeanwhile, every single day, you have rampant incitement and children being taught to hate Israel and hate the Jews. It has to stop. When you live in a society where the firefighters are the hero\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, little kids want to be firefighters. When you live in a society where athletes and movie stars are the heroes, little kids want to be athletes and movie stars. In Palestinian society, the heroes are those who murder Jews. we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let this continue. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let this happen any longer.\\nYou cannot achieve peace if terrorists are treated as martyrs. Glorifying terrorists is a tremendous barrier to peace. It is a horrible, horrible way to think. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a barrier that can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be broken. That will end, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll end soon, believe me. In Palestinian textbooks and mosques, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a culture of hatred that has been fermenting there for years, and if we want to achieve peace, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to go out, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to start this educational process. They have to end education of hatred. They have to end it, and now!\\nThere is no moral equivalency. Israel does not name public squares after terrorists. Israel does not pay its children to stab random Palestinians. You see, what President Obama gets wrong about deal making is that he constantly applies pressure to our friends and rewards our enemies. And you see that happening all the time. That pattern practiced by the President and his administration, including former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, who is a total disaster by the way. She and President Obama have treated Israel very, very badly. But its repeated itself over and over again, and has done nothing to embolden those who hate America. We saw that with releasing the $150 billion dollars to Iran in the hope that they would magically join the world community. It didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen.\\nPresident Obama thinks that applying pressure to Israel will force the issue, but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s precisely the opposite that happened. Already, half of the population of Palestine has been taken over by the Palestinian ISIS in Hamas, and the other half refuses to confront the first half, so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very difficult situation thats never going to get solved, unless you have great leadership right here in the United States. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get it solved, one way or the other. We will get it solved. But when the United States stands with Israel, the chances of peace really rise, and rises exponentially. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what will happen when Donald Trump is President of the United States.\\nWe will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem. And we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between America and our most reliable ally, the State of Israel. The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is absolutely, totally unbreakable. They must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against Israel. They must do that. And they must come to the table willing to accept that Israel is a Jewish State and it will forever exist as a Jewish State.\\nI love the people in this room. I love Israel. I love Israel. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been with Israel so long in terms of, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve received some of my greatest honors from Israel. My father before me, incredible. My daughter Ivanka is about to have a beautiful Jewish baby. In fact it could be happening right now which would be very nice as far as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m concerned.\\nSo I want to thank you very much. This has been a truly great honor. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much.\\nWow. Thank you very much. Hello. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to begin by thanking the people of Montana, South Dakota, New Mexico, New Jersey and California. We had some big, big days and we have some big numbers coming in, very big numbers.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m truly honored by your support. Together, we accomplished what nobody thought was absolutely possible and you know what that is and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re only getting started and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be beautiful, remember that.\\nTonight we close one chapter in history and we begin another. Our campaign received more primary votes than any GOP campaign in history, no matter who it is, no matter who they are, we received more votes. This is a great feeling. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great feeling.\\nThis is not a testament to me but a testament to all of the people who believed real change, not Obama change, but real change is possible. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve given me the honor to lead the Republican Party to victory this fall. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do it. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do it, folks. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do it.\\nI understand the responsibility of carrying the mantle and I will never, ever let you down \\xe2\\x80\\x93 too much work, too many people, blood, sweat and tears. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m never going to let you down. I will make you proud of your party and our movement, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what it is, is a movement.\\nNow recent polls have shown that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m beating Hillary Clinton and with all of her many problems and the tremendous mistakes that she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s made and she has tremendous mistakes, we expect our lead to continue to grow and grow substantially. To everyone who voted for me throughout this campaign, I want to thank you. I want to thank you very, very much.\\nTo those who voted for someone else in either party, I will work hard to earn your support and I will work very hard to earn that support. To all of those Bernie Sanders voters who have been left out in the cold by a rigged system of super delegates, we welcome you with open arms. And by the way, the terrible trade deals that Bernie was so vehemently against and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right on that will be taken care of far better than anyone ever thought possible and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I do. We are going to have fantastic trade deals. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to start making money and bringing in jobs.\\nNow I know some people say I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m too much of a fighter. My preference is always peace, however and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve shown that. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve shown that for a long time. I built an extraordinary business on relationships and deals that benefit all parties involved, always. My goal is always again to bring people together. But if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m forced to fight for something I really care about, I will never, ever back down and our country will never, ever back down.\\nThank you. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve fought for my family. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve fought for my business. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve fought for my employees. And now, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to fight for you, the American people like nobody has ever fought before. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not a politician fighting, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m me. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to see some real good things happen.\\nJust remember this: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to be your champion. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to be America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s champion because you see this election isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t about Republican or Democrat; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about who runs this country \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the special interests or the people and I mean the American people.\\nEvery election year politicians promise change. Obama promised change and it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work out too well. And every year they fail to deliver. Why would politicians want to change a system that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s totally rigged in order to keep them in power? That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing, folks. Why would politicians want to change a system that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s made them and their friends very, very wealthy? I beat a rigged system by winning with overwhelming support, the only way you could\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 landslides all over the country with every demographic on track to win; 37 primary caucus victories in a field that began with 17 very talented people.\\nAfter years of disappointment, there is one thing we all have learned \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fix the rigged system by relying on very, and I mean this so, so strongly, on the very people who rigged it, and they rigged it, and do not ever think anything differently. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t solve our problems by counting on the politicians who created our problems.\\nThe Clintons have turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made hundreds of millions of dollars selling access, selling favors, selling government contracts, and I mean hundreds of millions of dollars. Secretary Clinton even did all of the work on a totally illegal private server. Something about how she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s getting away with this folks nobody understands.\\nDesigned to keep her corrupt dealings out of the public record, putting the security of the entire country at risk and a President in a corrupt system is totally protecting her \\xe2\\x80\\x93 not right. I am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons. I think you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to find it very informative and very, very interesting. I wonder if the press will want to attend, who knows.\\nHillary Clinton turned the State Department into her private hedge fund \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the Russians, the Saudis, the Chinese \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all gave money to Bill and Hillary and got favorable treatment in return. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a sad day in America when foreign governments with deep pockets have more influence in our own country than our great citizens.\\nI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to do this. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not easy, believe me. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to do it. But I felt I had to give back to our wonderful country which has been so good to me and to my family. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve traveled to many of our states and seen the suffering in people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve visited communities in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Indiana and Ohio whose manufacturing jobs, they literally, these jobs have virtually disappeared, an embarrassment to our country and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s horrible. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve embraced the victims of illegal immigration, moms and dads who have had to bury their own children because of people that shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have been in the country \\xe2\\x80\\x93 remember it, folks, remember it.\\nI visited the crumbling cities and the struggling schools. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen our dilapidated airports, highways, bridges and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve compared them to other countries where we see facilities so far superior to ours it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really not to be believed, hard to imagine what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happened to our country. America is getting taken apart piece by piece, auctioned off, and just rapidly, auctioned off to the highest bidder. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re broke, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re broke. We owe $19 trillion dollars going quickly to $21 trillion. Our infrastructure is a disaster. Our schools are failing. Crime is rising. People are scared. The last thing we need is Hillary Clinton in the White House or an extension of the Obama disaster.\\nWhat a crowd, what a crowd. Thank you all very much. We love our country, we love our country. But we can turn this all around. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do it by putting America first. That commitment is the foundation for change that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been missing and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been missing for a long time. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to understand what America First means. It means on foreign policy we will never enter into any kind conflict unless it makes us safer as a nation. It has to make us safer as a nation. This is the opposite of Hillary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s foreign policy which invaded Libya, destabilized Iraq, unleashed ISIS and threw Syria into chaos and created the mass migration which is wreaking havoc all over the world, and while putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons and making them a dominant power in the Middle East and they are dominant and we have made them that way, folks. We have made them that way.\\nYou better hope I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m President. On trade, America First means the American worker will have his or her job protected from unfair foreign competition. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening there is absolutely a disgrace. No PPP, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re right about that and you mean no PP. We are going, and remember this; we are only going to have great trade deals, OK. We are only going to have that. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to approve, as somebody just said, the TransPacific Partnership which is a disaster, a disaster, for our country, almost as bad as NAFTA signed by Bill Clinton, which has just stripped our country of our factories and our manufacturing and moved them to other places, in particular Mexico. If it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a great deal for our country, we will not sign it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to be great for our country, for our community, for everybody in here because believe me we are all suffering and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re suffering bigly and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s getting worse.\\nOn energy policy, America First means opening up America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great potential to bring wealth and prosperity to our own workers including our wonderful and hard-working miners who have been absolutely totally mistreated by this Administration.\\nOn economic policy, America First means having tax and regulatory policies that keep jobs and wealth in the United States, substantially lowering taxes for middle class Americans and business; likewise, regulation which is strangling our economy which would be brought down from its present insane level. We will make it very, very good for our companies, for our small business and for people that want to survive and do well in our country.\\nOn immigration policy, America First means protecting the jobs, wages and security of American workers, whether first or tenth generation. No matter who you are, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to protect your job because let me tell you our jobs are being stripped from our country like we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re babies. The beauty of America First is that it brings us all together. Every American worker of every background is entitled to the same benefits, protections and rights and privileges; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to be that way. Now, the people in charge say things can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t change. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m here today to tell you that we have to change. We have no choice. We have to change.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to put America back to work. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make our own products. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to put America back to work. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to rebuild our inner cities which are absolutely a shame and so sad. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take care of our African American people that have been mistreated for so long. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make you and your family safe, secure and prosperous, prosperous again. Together, we will put the American people first again, first again.\\nWe will make our communities wealthy. We will make our cities safe again. We will make our country strong again. Ladies and gentlemen, we will make America great again, remember. Thank you. Thank you very much everybody.\\nThank you for joining me today.\\nThis was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and how bad a President, especially in these times of Radical Islamic Terrorism, she would be.\\nEven her former Secret Service Agent, who has seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be president.\\nThere will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will deliver that speech soon.\\nBut today there is only one thing to discuss: the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders.\\nThe attack on the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was the worst terrorist strike on our soil since September 11th, and the worst mass shooting in our country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history.\\nSo many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace.\\nThe horror is beyond description.\\nThe families of these wonderful people are totally devastated. Likewise, our whole nation, and indeed the whole world, is devastated.\\nWe express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families.\\nWe mourn, as one people, for our nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loss \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and pledge our support to any and all who need it.\\nI would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of the attack.\\n[SILENCE]\\nOur nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlando\\'s LGBT Community.\\nThis is a very dark moment in America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history.\\nA radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation.\\nIt is a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation.\\nIt is an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want and express their identity.\\nIt is an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country.\\nWe need to respond to this attack on America as one united people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with force, purpose and determination.\\nBut the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and think and act clearly.\\nIf we don\\'t get tough, and we don\\'t get smart \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and fast \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we\\'re not going to have a country anymore -- there will be nothing left.\\nThe killer, whose name I will not use, or ever say, was born to Afghan parents who immigrated to the United States. His father published support for the Afghan Taliban, a regime which murders those who don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t share its radical views. The father even said he was running for President of that country.\\nThe bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here.\\nThat is a fact, and it\\'s a fact we need to talk about.\\nWe have a dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens.\\nWe have an incompetent administration, and if I am not elected President, that will not change over the next four years -- but it must change, and it must change now.\\nWith fifty people dead, and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around the issue anymore -- we have to address it head on.\\nI called for a ban after San Bernardino, and was met with great scorn and anger but now, many are saying I was right to do so -- and although the pause is temporary, we must find out what is going on. The ban will be lifted when we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screen those people coming into our country.\\nThe immigration laws of the United States give the President the power to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons that the President deems detrimental to the interests or security of the United States, as he deems appropriate.\\nI will use this power to protect the American people. When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats.\\nAfter a full, impartial and long overdue security assessment, we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of America.\\nWe cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer.\\nMany of the principles of Radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions.\\nRadical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti-American.\\nI refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, and Jewish people, are the targets of persecution and intimidation by Radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not just a national security issue. It is a quality of life issue.\\nIf we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans \\xe2\\x80\\x93 women and children, gay and straight, Jews and Christians and all people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 then we need to tell the truth about Radical Islam.\\nWe need to tell the truth, also, about how Radical Islam is coming to our shores.\\nWe are importing Radical Islamic Terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system -- and through an intelligence community held back by our president.\\nEven our own FBI Director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of the people we are letting into America.\\nAll of the September 11th hijackers were issued visas.\\nLarge numbers of Somali refugees in Minnesota have tried to join ISIS.\\nThe Boston Bombers came here through political asylum.\\nThe male shooter in San Bernardino \\xe2\\x80\\x93 again, whose name I won\\'t mention -- was the child of immigrants from Pakistan, and he brought his wife \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the other terrorist - from Saudi Arabia, through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.\\nImmigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five-fold in just one year. According to Pew Research, 99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law.\\nWe admit many more from other countries in the region who share these same oppressive views.\\nIf we want to remain a free and open society, then we have to control our borders.\\nYet, Hillary Clinton \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for months and despite so many attacks \\xe2\\x80\\x93 repeatedly refused to even say the words \"radical Islam,\" until I challenged her yesterday to say the words or leave the race.\\nHowever, Hillary Clinton \\xe2\\x80\\x93 who has been forced to say the words today after policies she supports have caused us so much damage \\xe2\\x80\\x93 still has no clue what Radical Islam is, and won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t speak honestly about what it is.\\nShe is in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the world.\\nIn fact, just a few weeks before the San Bernardino slaughter, Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words Radical Islam. Here is what she said: \"Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.\"\\nHillary Clinton says the solution is to ban guns. They tried that in France, which has among the toughest gun laws in the world, and 130 were brutally murdered by Islamic terrorists in cold blood. Her plan is to disarm law-abiding Americans, abolishing the 2nd amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns. She wants to take away Americans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 guns, then admit the very people who want to slaughter us.\\nI will be meeting with the NRA, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a Presidential race, to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror.\\nThe bottom line is that Hillary supports the policies that bring the threat of Radical Islam into America, and allow it to grow overseas.\\nIn fact, Hillary Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more Radical Islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our security but our way of life.\\nWhen it comes to Radical Islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it\\'s deadly.\\nThe Obama Administration, with the support of Hillary Clinton and others, has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence-gathering and failing to support law enforcement. They have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else.\\nI refuse to be politically correct.\\nI will do the right thing--I want to straighten things out and to Make America Great Again.\\nThe days of deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon.\\nAs President I will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks.\\nWe need an intelligence-gathering system second to none. That includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and with our allies.\\nI will have an Attorney General, a Director of National Intelligence, and a Secretary of Defense who will know how to fight the war on Radical Islamic Terrorism \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and who will have the support they require to get the job done.\\nWe also must ensure the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat.\\nThe Senate Subcommittee on Immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the United States since September 11th.\\nNearly a year ago, the Senate Subcommittee asked President Obama\\'s Departments of Justice, State and Homeland Security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the United States.\\nThese Departments refused to comply.\\nPresident Obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activity of any kind since 9/11.\\nThe public has a right to know how these people got here.\\nWe have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with, or support, radical groups and beliefs.\\nWe have to control the amount of future immigration into this country to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside America.\\nEven a single individual can be devastating, just look at what happened in Orlando. Can you imagine large groups?\\nTruly, our President doesn\\'t know what he is doing. He has failed us, and failed us badly, and under his leadership, this situation will not get any better -- it will only get worse.\\nEach year, the United States permanently admits more than 100,000 immigrants from the Middle East, and many more from Muslim countries outside the Middle East. Our government has been admitting ever-growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our security.\\nIn fact, Clinton\\'s State Department was in charge of the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas.\\nHaving learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan, including a 500% increase in Syrian refugees.\\nThis could be a better, bigger version of the legendary Trojan Horse.\\nWe can\\'t let this happen.\\nAltogether, under the Clinton plan, you\\'d be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of their children.\\nThe burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to screen who we are bringing in.\\nThe burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans.\\nThe burden is also on Hillary Clinton to tell us how she will pay for it. Her plan will cost Americans hundreds of billions of dollars long-term.\\nWouldn\\'t this money be better spent on rebuilding America for our current population, including the many poor people already living here?\\nWe have to stop the tremendous flow of Syrian refugees into the United States \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we don\\'t know who they are, they have no documentation, and we don\\'t know what they\\'re planning.\\nWhat I want is common sense. I want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values.\\nThat is the choice I put before the American people: a mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit America, or Hillary Clinton\\'s radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically-correct special interests.\\nWe\\'ve got to get smart, and tough, and vigilant, and we\\'ve got to do it now, because later is too late.\\nThe media talks about \"homegrown,\" terrorism, but Islamic radicalism, and the networks that nurture it, are imports from overseas.\\nYes, there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of the poor policies of the past. But the whole point is that it will be much, much easier to deal with our current problem if we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t keep on bringing in people who add to the problem.\\nFor instance, the controversial Mosque attended by the Boston Bombers had as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot.\\nThis shooter in Orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on Earth. Why would we admit people who support violent hatred?\\nHillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists to our country who suppress women, gays and anyone who doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t share their views.\\nShe can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have it both ways. She can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to oppress them.\\nHow does this kind of immigration make our life better? How does this kind of immigration make our country better?\\nWhy does Hillary Clinton want to bring people here\\xe2\\x80\\x94in vast numbers\\xe2\\x80\\x94who reject our values?\\nAsk yourself, who is really the friend of women and the LGBT community, Donald Trump with his actions, or Hillary Clinton with her words? Clinton wants to allow Radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country\\xe2\\x80\\x94they enslave women, and murder gays.\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want them in our country.\\nImmigration is a privilege, and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t support our communities \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all of our communities.\\nAmerica has already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth, and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny.\\nNot surprisingly, wages for our workers haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t budged in many years.\\nSo whether it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s matter of national security, or financial security, we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t afford to keep on going like this. We owe $19 trillion in debt, and no longer have options.\\nAll our communities, from all backgrounds, are ready for some relief. This is not an act of offense against anyone; it is an act of defense.\\nI want us all to work together, including in partnership with our Muslim communities. But Muslim communities must cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and they do know where they are.\\nI want to fix our schools, roads, bridges and job market. I want every American to succeed. Hillary Clinton wants to empty out the Treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our own citizens.\\nI want to protect our citizens \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all of our citizens.\\nThe terrorist attack on the Pulse Night Club demands a full and complete investigation into every aspect of the assault.\\nIn San Bernardino, as an example, people knew what was going on, but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it.\\nWe need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives, parents, friends and associates.\\nWe need to know if he was affiliated with any radical Mosques or radical activists and what, if any, is their immigration status.\\nWe need to know if he travelled anywhere, and who he travelled with.\\nWe need to make sure every single last person involved in this plan \\xe2\\x80\\x93 including anyone who knew something but didn\\'t tell us \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is brought to justice.\\nIf it can be proven that somebody had information about any attack, and did not give this information to authorities, they must serve prison time .\\nAmerica must do more \\xe2\\x80\\x93 much more \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to protect its citizens, especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientations.\\nIt also means we must change our foreign policy.\\nThe decision to overthrow the regime in Libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in Syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for ISIS to expand and grow.\\nThese actions, along with our disastrous Iran deal, have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our Muslim allies in the region.\\nThat is why our new goal must be to defeat Islamic terrorism, not nation-building.\\nFor instance, the last major NATO mission was Hillary Clinton\\'s war in Libya. That mission helped unleash ISIS on a new continent.\\nI\\'ve said NATO needs to change its focus to stopping terrorism. Since I\\'ve raised that criticism, NATO has since announced a new initiative focused on just that.\\nAmerica must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against Islamic terrorism, just like we did against communism in the Cold War.\\nWe\\'ve tried it President Obama\\'s way. He gave the world his apology tour, we got ISIS, and many other problems, in return.\\nI\\'d like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solidarity with the people of Orlando who have come under attack.\\nWhen I am President, I pledge to protect and defend all Americans who live inside of our borders. Wherever they come from, wherever they were born, all Americans living here and following our laws will be protected.\\nAmerica will be a tolerant and open society.\\nAmerica will also be a safe society.\\nWe will protect our borders at home.\\nWe will defeat ISIS overseas.\\nWe will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety.\\nWe will make America rich again.\\nWe will make America safe again.\\nWe will make American Great Again.\\nThank you.\\n...We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing really well. Iowa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been amazing. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been amazing. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing so well and I love this place and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m back here all the time and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to be here a lot in January.\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be so sick of me. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll probably say, \"We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the caucus, just forget it. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stand the guy any more.\"\\nNo, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to like me and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be back and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do a great job for you. Most importantly, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get to that office and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do the right thing. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do the right thing.\\nSo, a few things. A lot \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so much has happened.\\nYou know, when we first came out, we were all talking together. And we were talking border security, which we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re just doing so great with the border security.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to build a wall. Mexico\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to pay for the wall. We all know that. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have security. And the drugs are going to stop and the people that are going to come into the country but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to come into the country they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be legal, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re coming in legally, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way.\\nAnd it affects Iowa so much.\\nSo we were talking about. So we were talking about that. We were talking about repealing Obamacare. Boom. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be repealed. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be replaced.\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been seeing what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening but Obamacare is a total disaster. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dying of its own weight.\\nAnd by \\xe2\\x80\\x9917, meaning he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be playing golf and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be working very hard. But \\xe2\\x80\\x9917 instead you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not getting the people signed up. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been a lot of talk about it and a lot of stories about it.\\nObamacare\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dead but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll terminate it quicker than that.\\nAnd we will come up with something that will be so good, so much better.\\nPremiums are going through the roof. Deductibles are so high that unless you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re close to death, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never going to get to use. And even then I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get to use it really.\\nSo, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take care of that.\\nAnd by the way, we have a lot of good people. We have ethanol. Nobody is really \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we have the ethanol \\xe2\\x80\\x93 where are the ethanol people? Right?\\nI was here a month ago and I met with them all and they do a fantastic job. I toured the plants and they do a fantastic job but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so important. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s another form of let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stay away from OPEC and let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stay away from that Middle East stuff. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so important...\\nActually what I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand because the one guy that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s doing pretty good with me in Iowa is Ted Cruz and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nice guy. I mean, everything I say he agrees with me. No matter what I say.\\nI was going to do one really wild but he agrees.\\nBut with the ethanol, really, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to come a long way because he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right now for the oil.\\nBut I understand it. Oil pays him a lot of money. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to be for oil, right? The oil companies give him a lot of money.\\nBut I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m with you. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m with everybody. Look, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m self funding. I have no oil company. I have no special interest. I have no lobbyist that want me and you know, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re representing countries that are ripping off the country, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re representing companies that are ripping off our country.\\nAll I do is I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to be working for you folks. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do this thing together. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make America so great again and maybe better than ever before. So important.\\nSo when we first started, I talked about China how they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re ripping us and Japan and Mexico.\\nMexico both at the border and in trade. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re taking so many of our companies. Nabisco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s moving there with their big plant. Ford is moving there with a big plant. They took a big plant away from Tennessee \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a great state \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they took it away at the last moment.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to let that stuff. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do what we have to do, okay?\\nBut I talked about that...and I talk about it a lot. The fact is that about 2.5 weeks ago with Paris, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m speaking a little bit differently now.\\nBelieve me, I can take care of China in my back pocket. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy for me. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I do.\\nAnd we have all the cards. A lot of people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. You know, these politicians they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand we have the cards.\\nYou know, with China, our people pay tax. They pay no tax. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not supposed to be that way. They call it a tariff because it sounds better. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take care of that. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take care of all of that.\\nWhat happened is with Paris, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a different mindset.\\nAnd when the polls came out last week, my numbers went way up because people felt more secure with me.\\nNow, maybe it had to do \\xe2\\x80\\x93 who knows why? Who knows?\\nBut my poll numbers went up. And do you ever notice whenever there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something that I do that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proper but controversial, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d say \"Oh, now he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gone. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s it. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the end.\"\\nI won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go over all of the different things because maybe you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll change your minds.\\nBut they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d say, \"That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s over.\"\\nAnd then they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d come in, \"Sir, your poll number went up 9 points this week.\" I said, \"They did?\" Because I have to do what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right. I have to do what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right.\\nAnd you know what? If I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make it, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make it.\\nI have a good life. We all hopefully have a good life. I have a great family, nice people, wonderful people. They love me. I think. I hope. I think. But I have a great family and I built a great business.\\n...There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s such spirit...There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s such spirit no matter where I go. You know, I go to Dallas. We have 20,000. 35,000 people in Mobile, Alabama. 20,000 people in Oklahoma. Wherever we go in Iowa, we have these crowds. You know this is supposed to be...for like a record.\\nIt is big and yet it feels intimate. It feels good...\\n...So I changed a couple of weeks ago. When I saw Paris I changed. And a big, big part of what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing now is safety and security and smartness and smartness.\\nSort of interesting. You know, the slogan is \"Make America Great Again\" and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m adding \"Make America Great Again and Safe Again\" because we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel safe anymore.\\nAnd the problem we have now that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never had to this extent is the power of weaponry. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the power. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the tremendous power.\\nYou know, 100 years ago, I would have said \"Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not go.\" I said \"Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go there\" anyway. And I said it strongly \"Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to destabilize the Middle East.\"\\nBut the fact is right now, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have to do things because we have some really, really sick degenerates.\\nAnd the press \\xe2\\x80\\x93 look at all those cameras going all live, all \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, nobody else has cameras like this. They can make a speech 100 times they make a speech, nobody cares. Look at this.\\nAnd don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry, they never pan the crowd. You know, they never; they have me. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m walking around. I figured I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll walk around maybe they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get the crowd. They never pan the crowd. I tell them \"Pan the crowd\", they never do.\\n...I had a crowd 7,000 people last week. More. 7,000 people and in a confined space. They had 3,000 people outside that couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get in. My wife says, \"Darling, the speech was excellent. Did you have many people there?\" I said \"What?\" She said, \"Well, they never leave your face.\" They keep it purposely. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you the cameras may be a little screwed up where you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t move them, right?\\nBut every time there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a protester \"Well, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m protesting\" and it can be in the back lefthand corner of the room, the cameras swoop over there. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true.\\nNo, I used to think they couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t move. You know, maybe there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something with the crazy computers.\\nYou know, in the old days everything was better right? The car seats. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99d sit in your car and you want to move forward and back, you press a button. Bing, bing. Now, you have to open up things, press a computer, takes you 15 minutes.\\nWell, the same thing I figured with cameras. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think they moved. I figured they were fixed for certain reasons. And then I saw a protester and those cameras were bent in positions like you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe possible.\\nSo, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re very dishonest people. What can I say? Not all of them but most of them.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you, you have one of the most dishonest right here in your backyard. The Des Moines Register is the worst. They are the worst. The worst. No, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re very dishonest.\\nYou have some reporter named Jacobs. She is the worst. She will write \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s such misrepresentation. And so I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care. I mean, who cares? So I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m saying it right in their backyard. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re failing anyway. They probably won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be in business in two years. I think they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re losing a fortune. I think.\\nYou know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s funny. Every time the Des Moines Register does a poll, I always do badly.\\n...I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m only doing this so they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sue me but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind if they do. I hope they sue me because they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have enough money to sue me. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the good thing.\\nBut I believe and I may be wrong \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in fact, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m wrong but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my opinion that they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it properly because you know they poll like 300 or 400 people. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll explain it...You know, if they lose 20 people in the pocket. \"Oh, Trump? Oh, forget that one. Forget that one.\"\\nNow, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that they do that. Do you do that, Des Moines Register?\\nBut every time I have a Des Moines Register poll, I do poorly. I also do poorly with the Bloomberg polls. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know why.\\nBut we had a great poll come in \\xe2\\x80\\x93 CNN last couple of days \\xe2\\x80\\x93 where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leading I think by 13 points in Iowa. In Iowa.\\nAnd then we have another coming where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing well.\\nBut I think Des Moines Register has somebody says it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming out sometime. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll just tell you, watch \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"Trump disappears!\"\\nI think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do so well. I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re actually going to even do better. You know, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leading in most of the poll. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leading in every poll.\\nExcept Iowa there was one poll \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there was one poll, Monmouth \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d never even heard Monmouth. What the hell is Monmouth? What is Monmouth? Explain it. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like Monmouth. You know why I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like it? Because they always treat me badly also.\\nBut I only like polls that treat me well.\\nBut we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing so well. Nationwide, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leading every poll by tremendous. We just had one in Georgia \\xe2\\x80\\x93 44%. 44%. Think of that. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 44% with 15 people. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d take 44% if we had three people. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d take it if we had two people but I think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d take if we had three. But 44%.\\nCBS came out as you know, you probably saw that, New York Times two days ago and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re at 35% to a small number. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re killing everybody in every poll. Just one little outlier here.\\n...Again, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure when Des Moines comes out it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be a negative because I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe that poll.\\nBut we are going to win. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what. Honestly, Iowa is so important to me. I could say, \"Oh, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not do\" \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I am an evangelical. I am a Christian. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a Presbyterian. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a Presbyterian. I love Billy Graham.\\nFranklin Graham came out with the most beautiful statements. Franklin Graham. He was so incredible. He came out \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if you all saw the statements he came out with about Trump...He was so incredible. Franklin Graham was amazing, the son of Billy Graham, who was, you know, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nobody, nobody that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Billy Graham was unbelievable. If anybody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gone to his crusades, they were incredible.\\nBut so I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing really well with the evangelicals...\\nAnd by the way and again, I do like Ted Cruz but not a lot of evangelicals come out of Cuba in all fairness. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. Not a lot come out. But I like him nevertheless.\\nI think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do great and we are doing great with evangelicals. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing great with the Tea Party, leading with the Tea Party.\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing fantastic with all the young and middle. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing great with everybody.\\nAnd so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very important for me to win Iowa.\\nNow, I could put less pressure on myself and I could say, \"Oh, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care about Iowa. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care.\" But I do care. I do care so much about it. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re here all the time.\\nAnd then the lies happened. You know, when I was using Iowa, they lied so much. I said, \"The people of Iowa can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be that stupid or the people of the country can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \". I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m trying to make a point, right? So I said, \"The people of the country can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be that stupid.\" Well, they cut the \"country\" out so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s referring to Iowa.\\nI love you people. Remember that. Remember that.\\nI was talking about something, and I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even mention what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m talking about because the guy I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m talking about and was actually a very good guy.\\nBut I will say this. We want to win Iowa so bad. Because if I win Iowa, I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d run the table. I really do. I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d run the table. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99d go right through.\\nBecause we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leading big in New Hampshire \\xe2\\x80\\x93 every poll. Big. Big in New Hampshire. Christie got an endorsement from this crazy newspaper up there. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the weirdest deal I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen.\\nAnd you know the paper that was in his state called up and said, \"Are you sure about that? Nobody ever called us.\" They can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it. And we can get into that but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s irrelevant.\\nBut we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leading New Hampshire big. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leading in South Carolina like monstrous numbers. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leading...Nevada. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leading in Texas. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leading everywhere. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leading big in Florida.\\nNow, you have Rubio \\xe2\\x80\\x93 nice guy, by the way. You have Rubio and he is a nice guy but you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to vote. When people put you in a position to be a Senator, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to go and vote. You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be the number one person that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t vote in the Senate. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to say, \"Hey, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a young guy. I want to go and vote.\" You should stay there a little longer. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good guy. Stay there, go in, vote, create a nice record.\\nBut I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. How\\xe2\\x80\\x99s he doing in Iowa? Not too good. Right? He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not doing well. How\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Rubio doing? Not good.\\nI mean, it seems like a two-person race right now...and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an important race to me. So I just want to let you know it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very important.\\nSo with all of that, if we win Iowa, a lot of people say we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d just go through. I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll win virtually every state in the Union and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s over quickly. Over quickly.\\n...What about the Republican establishment? The establishment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got a problem, you know. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sort of like the fighters. You know, the great champions. Sometimes they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go into the hometown of a guy they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re fighting and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say, \"You know, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d never want to get a decision. We go for the knock-out. The knock-out is the knock-out.\" Because you get a lot of bad decisions. I know a lot about the world of sports, believe me, and they go into a hometown to fight and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a decision and they say, \"Uh, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in a problem\" and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d lose the fight that they won. The only way they win the fight definitely \\xe2\\x80\\x93 knock out.\\nSo, if we win Iowa, I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win everything after that. So I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to show how important Iowa is.\\n...I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll pledge this to Iowa. Even if I lose, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll pledge it, okay? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever said that in my life. If we go and win, Iowa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s staying right where it is in the chain. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not moving. You know, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a big move to move Iowa into a much further back position by the establishment. Folks, I win it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not happening, okay? You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re staying right here because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great.\\n...You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been paying into Social Security and Medicare, by the way. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s put them in. Because Medicare does work. With both, you have tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take care of that. Okay?\\nBut we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to cut your Social Security and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not cutting your Medicare. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take jobs back from all these countries that are ripping us off. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to become a wealthy country again. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be able to save your Social Security.\\n...I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe this number but I read it over \\xe2\\x80\\x93 who is the man that told me the number \\xe2\\x80\\x93 over 6 million people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are aged 112 and over are getting Social Security...But I heard it. I read it. A tremendous \\xe2\\x80\\x93 like 6 million people are getting Social Security. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re dead. Meaning somebody else is picking up...\\n...The press is going to have to check it because what do I know? But can you imagine, we have 6 million \\xe2\\x80\\x93 now, we know there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not 6 million, there may be one. But there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not 6 million.\\nAnybody in this room 112 or over? Because if they are, I want to shake your hand.\\nBut \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so 6 million over 112 years old picking up Social Security and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the beginning. So there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse.\\nWhat we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do is we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to save Medicare. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to save Social Security. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to raise the age or we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to do all the things that everyone else is talking about doing. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all talking about doing it, and you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to bring our jobs back. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make our economy incredible again.\\nMy tax proposal, which is in, and a great detail in terms of policy and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gotten tremendous reviews from a lot of people, a lot of great groups.\\nBut we are going to cut taxes tremendously for the middle class and for businesses because our middle class is being decimated.\\nAnd when that happens, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to see an economy that takes off. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get rid of a lot of that debt, if not all of it. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get rid of it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re at $19 trillion going t $21 trillion right.\\nYou know, if you go back eight or nine years, trillion wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even a word anybody knew and now it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like routine.\\nSo we are going to save your Social Security without cuts. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to bring the economy back. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make ourselves rich again.\\nA woman said to me in New Hampshire recently, she said, \"Mr. Trump, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m voting for you. I love you. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very crude when you say you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make our country rich again.\" I said, \"I know it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s crude. It sounds bad. But many things I say are crude. It sounds bad. But we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make our country great again unless we make our country rich again. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let everybody in the world rip us off.\\n...We just did a big interview with CNN just before this. And you know, Hillary \\xe2\\x80\\x93 was Hillary missing today? What happened? She was two hours late. No, did you hear?\\nNow, I may be wrong. If I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m one minute off, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll call me because they love Hillary. They love her. You know why. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know why. Why? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m trying to figure it. No, I heard she was a couple of hours late. Everybody left. You know what happened? She was sleeping. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m telling you. She couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get out of bed. She was sleeping. She was sleeping. Was right.\\n...\\nRemember, we built China. The money they took out of country, we rebuilt China. You go there, they have bridges all over the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they have bridges like the George Washington Bridge. Maybe I shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mention that particular bridge. But like bigger like the George Washington Bridge. Only a few people got that one; that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s okay.\\nBut they have bridges going up. We have rebuilt China. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve taken our jobs. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve taken our base. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve taken our manufacturing all over the place. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve taken our money. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve taken our money. Not going to happen anymore folks. Not going to happen anymore. Not going to happen.\\nI know the great business people. We have the greatest business people in the world. Guys like Carl Icahn. He calls me, \"Donald, I want to help. I want to help.\" The smartest people call. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to use the special interest guy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a donor.\\nWe use donors to negotiate with China because he gave some guy like, you know, whoever it might be. Because again, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the only one that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s self-funding my campaign. Everybody else isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\nThese guys \\xe2\\x80\\x93 when these guys give money to politicians to a large extent they own those politicians. They will do whatever the hell the special interests and the donors want.\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen with me.\\nSo, Social Security \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re saving it. Medicare \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re saving it. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make our country rich. Okay? Thank you, sweetheart.\\n...Yeah, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called the statute of limitations, right? And you know it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a six-year year statute. Maybe five but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably six. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a six-year statute. Yeah, you have to look at it.\\nLook, Hillary Clinton \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know this story. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a crime. She committed a crime.\\nNow, perhaps \\xe2\\x80\\x93 perhaps \\xe2\\x80\\x93 somebody, you know, we have to have a fair Justice Department and perhaps...we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have some really good Attorney General that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to say \"Well, you know\".\\nLook, we want to be fair to everybody. Okay? Including Hillary Clinton. But she committed a crime in my opinion.\\nNow, she shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be allowed to run. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being protected absolutely. I have little doubt that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to find anything. But they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve already found it.\\nI mean, you watch television. You have all these big scholars, these lawyers, \"Yes, she violated section so and so\". Just one after another. I mean, actually violated many, many laws, not just like a little one here. Many laws.\\nYou mentioned General Petraeus. His life was destroyed over 5% of what Hillary Clinton did. Over nothing.\\nSo I think she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be their nominee definitely. The only question is whether or not she\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be allowed to run. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being protected by the Democrats. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being protected by the President. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why \\xe2\\x80\\x93 why do you think she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going along with these insane policies of his? Okay? I mean, she goes along with everything.\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even \\xe2\\x80\\x93 honestly in all fairness to her, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think she believes it. But I think she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s afraid he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to say, \"Listen, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like her anymore. Go take care of her. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to get somebody else.\" I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m telling you.\\nSo, the question is statute of limitations. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a five year statute of limitations. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got a problem. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got a problem. In one way, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s running for her life because I know one thing, if she wins that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the end of that. Right? But if she loses she could have a very serious problem.\\n...\\n...Well, I said right at the beginning. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to build a wall that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be a real wall. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be a real wall.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you see that ceiling? That ceiling is nothing compared to the wall. And we can build it and we can build it right. And it will be strong and powerful and as beautiful as a wall is going to look. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to be beautiful because someday they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to name it the Trump Wall. I know that. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to happen. Going to happen.\\nAnd it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to work. And walls do work.\\nYou know, they wanted to build a wall here 20 years ago. You know they couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get environmental impact statements. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just shows you.\\nChina is building in the South China Sea massive military bases. Right? Why? They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not supposed to. They have no respect for Obama or our country. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not supposed to be doing that. And you could get them to stop just by saying \"We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not doing business with you anymore.\" Their whole economy would \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to go to war. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economics. The whole country would collapse in two seconds. Believe me. We have such power and we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know it.\\nBut they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re building massive \\xe2\\x80\\x93 now, they had little islands. They put the biggest escavators, not Caterpillars. I think they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re using Komatsu from Japan...They have these massive escavators, and I said to a friend of mine who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Chinese from China \\xe2\\x80\\x93 very rich guy, very successful guy, paid me a fortune for an apartment so I happen to like him, okay? \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I said jokingly \"How long did it take them to do these massive islands they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re building right out of the sea? Boom, those shovels go in, take out everything. How long did it take you to get the environmental impact statements?\" He laughed. He said, \"What are you kidding me? Nothing.\" They say \"We will build there.\" About two seconds later, you have escavators digging.\\nSo we had a problem with environmental \\xe2\\x80\\x93 look, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve won many environmental awards. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a big believer especially in clean air and clean water. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a big believer. Just so you know. Big. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gotten so many awards for the environment. So I understand the environment; I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve won many, many awards.\\nBut when you look at how we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re impinged and hurt. But the wall was stopped because they couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get an environmental impact statement among other things. They couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get an environmental impact statement.\\nNow, there was probably a snail or a turtle or a snake or something. You were ruining the habitat of a rattlesnake. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. But they actually had people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a lot of people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 people that now would be against it but they wanted to build a wall and years ago they couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get it done.\\n...You know, I said bomb the oil, right? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been saying that for three years. Now finally they started \\xe2\\x80\\x93 after Paris they started bombing the oil. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been saying it for years.\\nYou know one of the reasons we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bomb the oil? Obama didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to hurt the environment. Now, I heard that and I thought somebody was kidding. I thought a comedian was saying it. It turned out to be true. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want the flames and everything going into the atmosphere. This is the way we fight today.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m telling you, folks, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re being led by stupid people. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re being led by stupid people.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been saying not really bomb \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been saying take the oil. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to go into Iraq. But once we were there, I said \"Look, we shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have been there. But then when we left, we left the wrong way.\"\\nFirst of all, we have a president who told them a date. \"We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to leave on such and such a date.\" What was it like 18 months later? So the enemy all of sudden said, \"Wow\", \\xe2\\x80\\x98cause don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to be killed. Okay? They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to be killed. So the enemy said \"They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to leave on a certain date?\" So they pulled back, the date comes, and now you see what happened. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a disaster and Iran is taking over Iraq.\\nSo anyway, I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it when they said that. When we said to our 50 soldiers two weeks ago and our president gets up and announces \"We are sending 50 soldiers.\"\\nOkay, first of all, he thinks it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good press announcement. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not. 50 soldiers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a lot even though they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the elite. But those 50 soldiers because of that announcement have a target on their heart. They have a target on their heart.\\nWhy does he have to say that for? Why can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he let 50 soldiers go there quietly, stealth, stealth? Why can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he just do that? Why can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he do that?\\nThose 50 soldiers are in grave danger today because of that, and they probably don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know that but everybody is looking for them and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way it is.\\nWe have people that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing.\\nWe used to have General MacArthur \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Douglas MacArthur \\xe2\\x80\\x93 General George Patton. I mean, these were real people. These were real people.\\nToday, we have generals that go on talk shows...I saw a general the other day on a talk show. He said \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and this was serious and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good man. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re good men. But you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to lead these men. Even the generals have to have some power over them. He said, \"We are in the worst shape in terms of preparedness that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been in in decades.\" And this is the time when we have to be in the best shape because the world wants to kill us.\\nAnd he said we are in the worst shape we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been in many, many decades.\\nNow, number one, he shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be saying that because you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re telling the enemy that and the enemy feels embolden when they hear that. Right? We shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be saying it. We shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be saying it.\\nI mean, even if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say it. You get it fixed and you do the opposite.\\nOne thing I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to build our military so big and so strong and so powerful \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so powerful that nobody is going to mess with us. Nobody is going to mess with us.\\nYou know in many ways, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the cheapest thing you can do. Everyone is toying with us right now. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the cheapest thing you can do. The absolute cheapest thing you can do.\\n...I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a big Second Amendment person by the way.\\n...My sons are really great marksmen. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re big believers. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a member of the NRA but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not such a good shot. But they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re great shots so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of those things.\\nBut if you think about that question. So you know there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tremendous pressure to get rid of the guns, get rid of the magazines, no bullets. How about the one where they have three bullets in every magazine? ...So the people will put three bullets in. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think the bad guys are going to say, \"Well, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to break the law. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to go kill people today but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to put three bullets in.\" Right?\\nThese people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and you know I have arguments with them all the time and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a practical guy. Honestly, if I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe this, I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say it.\\nSo in France or in California, I have a permission to carry, which is a big thing in New York. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very hard to get. I have a license to carry.\\nBut in France or in California or in all these places where we see the shooters, right, if instead of having like in France hundreds of people in that room \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Paris has the toughest gun laws in the world. France has the toughest gun laws in the world. Nobody has guns. Except the bad guys.\\nSo they walk in with the worst, the toughest, the best weaponry you could have and they said, \"Over here \\xe2\\x80\\x93 boom. Over here \\xe2\\x80\\x93 boom.\" So they killed 128 but many more are dying right now. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in terrible shape in the hospitals. They just wipe the place out and they could\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve stayed there for longer. They wiped it out.\\nThen you had those two sleaze bags from California. The married couple. I saw the press \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"The young married couple that did the shooting\". They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not a young married couple. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the worst. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sleaze.\\n...They say \"The young married couple\". That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no young married couple.\\nSo they walk into a place and they killed 14 people and others are going to be dying probably because of a lot of other wounded people.\\nBut if somebody had guns in there \\xe2\\x80\\x93 nobody had a gun...How would you have done if you had a gun? Would you have been firing back a little bit? They\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been in trouble. Right? They would have been in trouble. Believe me. That guy.\\nSo, you know, I went to like an Ivy League college and I have a lot of friends that are against guns and I argue with them. I talk to them. I said, \"Okay, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in Paris. You have all these places and there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hundreds of people. Guys walk in with guns and you have no gun. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you think they would\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been better if they had?\" They can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they lose the argument but they never change their mind.\\nSo we have to fight for the Second Amendment. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so simple. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so simple.\\nAnd believe me, believe me, they want to take those guns away and you always know that the bad ones are going to have the guns and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have them more so than ever before. So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to protect the Second Amendment if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m president. That I can tell you.\\nAnd by the way, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be saying Merry Christmas again. Do you ever notice?\\n...And by the way, Merry Christmas everybody. Merry Christmas. And happy holiday.\\nFrankly, I have a lot of friends that aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Christian. They like Christmas. Everybody likes Christmas. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s politically incorrect to say Merry Christmas. But when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m president, Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, enjoy yourselves, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t eat too much turkey. Right?\\nOkay, so we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to say Merry Christmas again folks. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to bring that spirit back.\\n...I really do. I like Ted Cruz a lot. And he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s doing well. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing well. I mean, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a contest between the two of us, just so we understand. We have to make that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but I do like him.\\nAnd I would say that we would certainly have things in mind for Ted, to be honest with you.\\nI mean, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s somebody that I can certainly see that because I like him, he likes me. He actually put out a tweet tonight. He said \"Donald Trump is\" \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I think he used the word \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"terrific\". That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nice word. I mean, whoever hears that?\\nI can tell you other candidates are not exactly saying that about me. Right?\\n...\\n...So the Super PACs are horrible and I had many set up for me by people I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. I mean, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d see them on television talking about \\xe2\\x80\\x93 somebody named one \"The Art of the Deal PAC\". Two young guys. They look good. I mean, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know.\\nBut then I got to be, you know, started going around and I see the corruption with these Super PACs, with the stuff towards money. People that put the money in are dealing with the candidates. The whole thing is wrong.\\nAnd I see it. I mean, Bush has $125 million. Think of it. $125 million. By the way, if he had $2 billion it wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make any difference. Okay?\\nBut Bush has $125 million. And honestly, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nice person. He is. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to do that but he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very nice person. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s $125 million. And you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d say to yourself, \"People give $2 million, $5 million, $7 million. You know what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening.\"\\nBut some of the Super PACs are running campaigns. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re actually running the campaign.\\nAnother thing and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sort of interesting, one of the Super PACs I believe has $6 million. Of the $6 million \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this was reported on the front page of the Los Angeles Times \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one of the candidates who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nice person so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to mention the name. You know, when I like people I like them. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a very loyal person.\\nOf the $6 million after all of the bloodsuckers took their cuts, the fundraisers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 can you believe this? \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they had $140,000 left for the campaign. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s better than being a real estate broker. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rather do that than sell houses. $140,000 left. That was in the newspaper. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. I think I believe it.\\nBut I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen it. I saw it with the Romney campaign. Guys made tens of millions of dollars raising money for Romney. I said what the hell is this? I mean, you give money and they get a cut.\\nLook, our laws are so corrupt. Our campaign finance laws are so totally corrupt. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so horrible. So horrible.\\nAnd I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily want to stop people from giving because I think that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good thing but you have to get away from these PACs.\\nWhat you have to have is people have to know who it is. So you have to open up the process. Let people know. If somebody wants to give $1 million, you give $1 million but everybody has to know that so and so gave $1 million because that puts a little pressure on guys like Brad who raises hundreds of millions. Puts a little pressure.\\nBut the concept of the PAC is no good. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no good. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very dangerous, terrible thing. So we will change our laws because you really have no choice. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so out of control. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so terrible.\\nBut the papers that are in this room tonight, they should look at this. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so little money left over for the candidates, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the reasons why I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m so happy I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing my own.\\nWe actually sent legal letters to either nine or 11 PACs. The Trump PAC, the Trump PAC, the this PAC. First of all, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure that out of some of them they stole the money. Some guy has no money. He sets up a Trump something PAC. Nothing to do with me. Sets it up. All of a sudden he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got $2 million sitting there. Right? People send in money. And that guy has no money. How much of that money do you think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to use to do what he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supposed to be doing? That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s common sense. So maybe all of it but I doubt it.\\nSo we sent legal notices to every one that we could find. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want their money. We said \"Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want it. And we want ideally to give the money back to the people that gave it to you.\"\\nBut the Super PAC concept is corrupt. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s terrible and it should be ended. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to go to new campaign finance laws that are going to be terrific. Okay? Thank you.\\n...Well, look he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s [referring to Cruz] from Texas. To the best of my knowledge, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot of oil in Texas. Right? So you know, he gets a lot of money from the oil companies and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s totally against ethanol and everything else you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about.\\nAnd I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m totally in favor.\\nAnd you know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a big industry here. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a big industry.\\nYou know, if that industry is upset, Iowa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got problems.\\nI was amazed. I was here three weeks ago with the group...They were such amazing people...And I learned so much about it. I was in favor of it even before...\\n...Beyond even the fuel capacities, which we want to create as much as we can, tremendous numbers of jobs in Iowa. And I said to myself, if Ted Cruz is against ethanol, how does he win in Iowa? Because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very anti-Iowa. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how he wins in Iowa. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know.\\nNo, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m totally for it. Okay? Thank you.\\n...I was a member of the establishment six months ago. I gave $350,000 to the RGA. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the Republican Governors Association. I gave tremendous amounts of money away. I was like the fair haired boy.\\nOnce I said I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m running, they said \"What? You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not supposed to run.\"\\nAnd then what happened \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I ran against all these Senators and Governors. And everyone said \"Well, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know.\" My wife said \"If you run, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win\" because she understands that I like people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I love people and people love me. And she said \"You will run but you actually have to go and run. You have to announce you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re running because nobody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to believe you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re running.\"\\nAnd so I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to announce because I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to like announce and things didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work out and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m like some of these guys where they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re zero. Many of them zero.\\nAnd so finally I said, \"Look, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do it. We have to do it.\"\\nJust too many things that I watch on television with our president and the decisions that are made \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Bergdahl \\xe2\\x80\\x93 where we get Bergdahl and they get five killers. We get this horrible, dirty rotten spy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 horrible traitor. We get this horrible, terrible traitor and they get five killers that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve wanted for nine years \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the worst killers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all back on the battlefield.\\nYou know, so many decisions. The Iran deal. The Iran deal. How bad is that? They self-inspect. \"Okay, good. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not building. We promise we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not building nuclear weapons.\" \"Oh, okay. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s okay.\"\\nAnd we give them $150 billion and we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even get our prisoners back. The whole thing is crazy. So I saw this. And I said to my wife, \"Hey, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do well or not. Who the hell knows?\"\\nAnd it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a risky thing. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always heard if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a very successful person you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t run for office, especially for president, and I see it all the time. And the people go after me. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even care at this point. I said, \"I have to do it. Now, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have to do it.\"\\nAnd I look at it last time with Romney and I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it and I probably should have because he let us down. I mean, look, he let us down.\\nThat was an election \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we had a failed president. Four years ago he was a failed president, just as bad as he is now. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. And Romney let us down. That last month \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it was like he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even campaigning.\\nI said, \"Why aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you on Jay Leno? Why aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you on David Letterman? Why aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you doing it?\" And he just didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it. So he lost the election.\\nSo I backed McCain, he lost. I backed Romney, he lost. This time I said I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing it myself, okay? We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win.\\nBut there is an establishment out there. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a real establishment. Real people. And they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re people that are used to having their little puppets all over the place. And they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re people that are used to giving donations and having control.\\nAnd they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re people that, you know, look when they call me I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll treat them with respect but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to be doing bad things if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bad for the country. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to let Ford build a plant in Mexico if I can keep it in Michigan.\\nAnd I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to let the car companies and Nabisco and all these people and all these companies \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m all for free trade. I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m for it. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to be smart trade. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to let them move to Mexico and then sell stuff over the border with no tax, no nothing so we lose our jobs, we lose our factories, they go over here, they make it, we let them come through. How does that help us, folks? I went to the best business school in the world. Believe me, it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help us. Okay? Trust me.\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to make deals like that anymore. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. We owe $19 trillion. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\nSo the establishment is not ever probably \\xe2\\x80\\x93 look, you know what? In the end, if this country starts humming even the establishment they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be saying \"Okay, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good thing\" because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be beneficiaries also.\\nBut we do have a real establishment and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never seen this happen before.\\nA writer called up and he said recently \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I told this story. I mean, one of the top journalists to my way of thinking certainly in the country and beyond. And he said, \"Mr. Trump, how does it feel?\" I said, \"How does what feel?\" \"How does it feel? What you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done has never, ever been done before?\" I said, \"What have I done?\" \"You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve dominated the Summer of Trump.\" Now they call it the Autumn of Trump.\\nHopefully, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to call it the Spring of Trump and I want the next Autumn of Trump.\\nBut I said to the writer, \"I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t done anything \\xe2\\x80\\x98cause frankly if I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win I consider this to be a total waste of time.\" I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be honest with you. As much as I like being with you tonight. Because we won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be able to do anything.\\nHe said, \"No, no. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve won even if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve won already.\" I said, \"No, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re wrong. If I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win, I have wasted my time.\"\\nSo you know, the point is that the establishment can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never seen it happen before.\\n...I was on the cover of Time Magazine four or five weeks ago and Time Magazine was going to pick the Person of the Year. Everybody \\xe2\\x80\\x93 even my enemies \\xe2\\x80\\x93 said \"Trump is going to win.\" I said, \"I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win.\" They said, \"Why?\" \"I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win. Just like I should have gotten the Emmy for The Apprentice for the first three years. I was nominated. I should have.\" And I said, \"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never win.\" I told everybody I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never win because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not Hollywood establishment.\\nAnd with Time Magazine, I said \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Bill O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Reilly, who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great guy, did an editorial at the end of his show two days ago saying nobody has done more than Trump, he should have won.\\nNow, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not saying I should have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 yeah, I probably should have in all fairness \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but he said \"Nobody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s done more\" \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, taking over \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done has been amazing \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all of us together not just me. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all of us. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all of us. From Dallas and Mobile and Oklahoma. All of us. Because the spirit.\\n...Well, Merkel got it. Now, Merkel, what did she do? She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s destroyed \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I mean, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in the process of destroying Germany with the migration.\\nWe have to help the people with the migration. We have to create a safe zone some place in Syria. But I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want them coming into this country. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want them because we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know who they are. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know who they are. Them with their printing press that now do the forged passports. Okay? You heard about that. So we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know.\\nThe bottom line on that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s such an interesting question. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll know in about a month or two whether or not the establishment has treated me fairly.\\nBut the only thing I can say is this: If I win Iowa, I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s over. I said before. Because I think if I win Iowa, New Hampshire is amazing. People are amazing. You would love the people. They would love you. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99d love everybody. The whole country is in love...I call it the noisy majority. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no longer a silent majority. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the noisy majority.\\nBut if we win like I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win because we have such a big league, honestly, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to matter. They can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do anything. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care about the establishment. They can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do anything.\\nYou know, the only way they can do is if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a little bit short, if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m two votes short I have a problem because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to go into that convention, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m dealing with all these blood sucker politicians and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll make their deals and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have all their money guys around and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be in the backroom making deals.\\nBut if I get the number of delegates, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a thing they can do. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll end up doing fine with the establishment...\\n...I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m such a believer in education.\\nYou know, I had an uncle who was a professor at MIT who was a brilliant guy...In fact, I just retweeted an article about him today. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to read it. Okay? @RealDonaldTrump. You have to read it.\\nWhen I see somebody like Jeb \\xe2\\x80\\x93 no I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you one thing I respect. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t change his views. He knew he was getting killed on this issue and he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t change. And I respect that to a certain extent. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so wrong.\\nCommon Core is a total disaster. We have people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 bureaucrats in Washington \\xe2\\x80\\x93 telling you how your child should be educated in Iowa and New Hampshire and all of the different places that we go to. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ridiculous.\\nAnd I go around and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen the principals. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen so many students and teachers and professors and principals, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen some of the people and the love \\xe2\\x80\\x93 even in Iowa at a school \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen some of the love these parents give to those schools. This is real love. These are smart people. And these are people that aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t working for a paycheck. These are incredible people...\\nRemember this: Our educational system is a mess. We spend more money per pupil as a government than any other country in the world and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in 28th place. And I mean like double what anybody else pays.\\nSo I want to bring education back to the local areas. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have parents and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have unbelievably talented people and they love their kids and they want their kids to be well-educated because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so important. And you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be very happy with it. Okay? Thank you. Thank you.\\n...You people do it. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re backing you 100%...We are backing you 100%. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing a phenomenal job. There should be more people like you in this country.\\nYou know, the whole grid is a disaster. Right? The whole country. The infrastructure of our country is falling apart.\\nAnd nobody can build like me. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I do. I build. I build.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m building on \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as you know \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Pennsylvania Avenue a big tremendous hotel that I got from the government of the United States. Can you believe it? During the Obama administration a couple of years ago.\\nBut we had the best plan. The GSA is terrific. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re very good. Actually, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re very talented people.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re under-budget and ahead of schedule. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we do.\\nWhen you see these things where they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re building a bridge and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to cost, you know, $1 billion and it costs $12 billion. How about when they build a hospital and it costs $3 billion?\\nAnd I look at it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very good \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I can look at a building and tell you how much it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to cost.\\nI say \"$250 million.\" \"No, sir, $3 billion.\" $3 billion? Think somebody got rich on that one?\\nSo we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to stop all this stuff. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make our country so strong and so wonderful. And we all love it anyways. We love it.\\nBut it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so sad to see what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so sad. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to change it around.\\n...We have such a problem. And the biggest problem I have, you know, it relates to education and the hardest thing you get is when you go around and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d see students and so many students come out to hear us and they always want to talk about the loans \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they have student loans \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going through nice colleges, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re good students, they work hard, they could be really top in their class and they get out and they say, \"Mr. Trump, we have no jobs. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get jobs.\"\\nSo they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re borrowed up to the hilt and they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get jobs.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to bring our jobs back from China. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to bring our jobs back from all these places overseas that have stolen our jobs.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to bring our jobs back from South America. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re bringing them back from Mexico. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have jobs again. Believe me. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be manufacturers again.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to start making Apple computers in this country. What the hell good does it do to make them in China? I want to make them in this country and we have the ability to do it.\\nSo, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to bring our jobs back. Okay?\\nWow! Thank you very much.\\nHello.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to begin by thanking the people of Montana, South Dakota, New Mexico, New Jersey, and California. We had some big, big days and we have some big numbers coming in. Very big numbers.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m truly honored by your support.\\nTogether, we accomplished what nobody thought was absolutely possible and you know what that is. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re only getting started and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be beautiful. Remember that.\\nTonight, we close one chapter in history and we begin another. Our campaign received more primary votes than any GOP campaign in history. No matter who it is, no matter who they are, we received more votes.\\nThis is a great feeling. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great feeling.\\nThis is not a testament to me but a testament to all of the people who believed real change, not Obama change, but real change is possible.\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve given me the honor to lead the Republican Party to victory this fall.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do it. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do it, folks. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do it.\\nI understand the responsibility of carrying the mantle and I will never, ever let you down. Too much work, too many people, blood, sweat, and tears. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m never going to let you down.\\nI will make you proud of your party and our movement, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what it is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a movement.\\nNow, recent polls have shown that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m beating Hillary Clinton and with all of her many problems and the tremendous mistakes that she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s made and she has made tremendous mistakes, we expect our lead to continue to grow and grow substantially.\\nTo everyone who voted for me throughout this campaign, I want to thank you. I want to thank you very, very much.\\nTo those who voted for someone else in either party, I will work hard to earn your support and I will work very hard to earn that support.\\nTo all of those Bernie Sanders voters who have been left out in the cold by a rigged system of super delegates, we welcome you with open arms.\\nAnd by the way, the terrible trade deals that Bernie was so vehemently against \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right on that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will be taken care of far better than anyone ever thought possible. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I do.\\nWe are going to have fantastic trade deals. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to start making money and bringing in jobs.\\nNow, I know some people say I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m too much of a fighter. My preference is always peace, however. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve shown that. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve shown that for a long time.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve built an extraordinary business on relationships and deals that benefit all parties involved \\xe2\\x80\\x93 always.\\nMy goal is always again to bring people together. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m forced to fight for something I really care about, I will never, ever back down and our country will never, ever back down.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve fought for my family. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve fought for my business. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve fought for my employees. And now I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to fight for you \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the American people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 like nobody has ever fought before.\\nAnd I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not a politician fighting. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m me. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to see some real good things happen.\\nJust remember this: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to be your champion. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to be America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s champion.\\nBecause, you see, this election isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t about Republican or Democrat. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about who runs this country \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the special interests or the people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I mean the American people.\\nEvery election year politicians promised change. Obama promised change and it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work out too well. And every year, they failed to deliver.\\nWhy would politicians want to change a system that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s totally rigged in order to keep them in power? That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing, folks.\\nWhy would politicians want to change a system that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s made them and their friends very, very wealthy?\\nI beat a rigged system by winning with overwhelming support \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the only way you could have done it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 landslides all over the country with every demographic, on track to win 37 primary/caucus victories in a field that began with 17 very talented people.\\nAfter years of disappointment, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one thing we all have learned \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fix the rigged system by relying on very \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I mean this so, so strongly \\xe2\\x80\\x93 on the very people who rigged it. And they rigged it and do not ever think anything differently.\\nWe can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t solve our problems by counting on the politicians who created our problems.\\nThe Clintons have turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves.\\nThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made hundreds of millions of dollars selling access, selling favors, selling government contracts, and I mean hundreds of millions of dollars.\\nSecretary Clinton even did all of the work on a totally illegal private server. Something that how she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s getting away with this folks nobody understands. Designed to keep her corrupt dealings out of the public record, putting the security of the entire country at risk, and a president in a corrupt system is totally protecting her. Not right.\\nI am going to give a major speech on probably Monday of next week, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the Clintons. I think you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to find it very informative and very, very interesting.\\nI wonder if the press would want to attend. Who knows?\\nHillary Clinton turned the State Department into a private hedge fund. The Russians, the Saudis, the Chinese all gave money to Bill and Hillary and got favorable treatment in return.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a sad day in America when foreign governments with deep pockets have more influence in our own country than our great citizens.\\nI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to do this. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not easy. Believe me. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to do it. But I felt I had to give back to our wonderful country, which has been so good to me and to my family.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve traveled to many of our states and seen the suffering in people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lives.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve visited communities in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Indiana, and Ohio whose manufacturing jobs \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they literally these jobs have virtually disappeared. An embarrassment to our country and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s horrible.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve embraced the victims of illegal immigration \\xe2\\x80\\x93 moms and dads who have had to bury their own children because of people that shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have been in the country. Remember it, folks. Remember it.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve visited the crumbling cities and the struggling schools.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen our dilapidated airports, highways, bridges, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve compared them to other countries where we see facilities so far superior to ours. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really not to be believed. Hard to imagine what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happened to our country.\\nAmerica is getting taken apart piece by piece, auctioned off, and just rapidly auctioned off to the highest bidder.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re broke. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re broke. We owe $19 trillion. Going quickly to $21 trillion.\\nOur infrastructure is a disaster. Our schools are failing. Crime is rising. People are scared.\\nThe last thing we need is Hillary Clinton in the White House or an extension of the Obama disaster.\\nWhat a crowd. What a crowd. Thank you all very much. We love our country. We love our country.\\nBut we can turn this all around. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do it by putting America first.\\nThat commitment is the foundation for change that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been missing and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been missing for a long time.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to understand what America First means.\\nIt means on foreign policy, we will never enter into any conflict unless it makes us safer as a nation. It has to make us safer as a nation.\\nThis is the opposite of Hillary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s foreign policy, which invaded Libya, destabilized Iraq, unleashed ISIS and threw Syria into chaos and created the mass migration, which is wrecking havoc all over the world and while putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons and making them a dominant power in the Middle East. And they are dominant and we have made them that way, folks, we have made them that way.\\nBetter hope I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m president.\\nOn trade, America First means the American worker will have his or her job protected from unfair foreign competition \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening here is absolutely a disgrace.\\nNo PPP [sic]. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re right about that. So and you mean no PP.\\nWe are going \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and remember this \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we are only going to have great trade deals. Okay? We are only going to have that.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to approve as somebody just said the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is a disaster \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a disaster \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for our country. Almost as bad as NAFTA signed by Bill Clinton, which has just stripped our country of our factories and our manufacturing and moved them to other places and in particular Mexico.\\nIf it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a great deal for our country, we will not sign it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to be great for our country, for our community, for everybody in here because believe me we are all suffering and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re suffering big league and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s getting worse.\\nOn energy policy, America First means opening up America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great potential to bring wealth and prosperity to our own workers, including our wonderful and hardworking miners who have been absolutely totally mistreated by this administration.\\nOn economic policy, America First means having tax and regulatory policies that keep jobs and wealth in the United States, substantially lowering taxes for middle class Americans and businesses. Likewise, regulation which is strangling our economy which would be brought down from its present insane level, we will make it very, very good for our companies, for our small businesses, and for people that want to survive and do well in our country.\\nOn immigration policy, America First means protecting the jobs, wages, and security of American workers. Whether first or tenth generation, no matter who you are, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to protect your job because let me tell you, our jobs are being stripped from our country like we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re babies.\\nThe beauty of America First is that it brings us all together. Every American worker of every background is entitled to the same benefits, protections and rights and privileges. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to be that way.\\nNow, the people in charge say things can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t change. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m here today to tell you that we have to change. We have no choice. We have to change.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to put America back to work. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make our own products. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to put America back to work.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to rebuild our inner cities, which are absolutely a shame and so sad, going to take care of our African-American people that have been mistreated for so long.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make you and your families safe, secure, and prosperous. Prosperous again.\\nTogether, we will put the American people first again. First again.\\nWe will make our communities wealthy. We will make our cities safe again. We will make our country strong again.\\nLadies and gentlemen, we will make America great again! Remember. Thank you!\\nThank you! Thank you very much everybody!\\nThank you, everybody. Thank you very much. This has been a great period of time. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been really amazing.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gotten the nomination. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have an incredible period in Cleveland. We look forward to it.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve started working already on the convention.\\nAnd LeBron, good luck in the series because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have the series, which of course the longer it goes the less time we have but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s okay. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be very interesting to see what happens.\\nBut as you know, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re playing the basketball championships partially in that arena so I think it will be very exciting. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll add to the excitement in Cleveland and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we want because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be an exciting period of time.\\nWe have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done some awfully good work. I was just informed...that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got more votes than anybody in the history of the Republican primaries and we still have I guess six or seven locations to go, states to go.\\nAnd in the history, think of it, in the history of this great party, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gotten substantially more votes than anybody else by millions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 by many millions more \\xe2\\x80\\x93 than anybody who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ever run.\\nSo that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great. You know, when you think Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan and everybody, we have the most votes by far. So that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something to me that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very exciting.\\nAnd overall, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just been a very exciting process. I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do very well.\\nWe have no idea what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to happen on the Democrat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re certainly having difficulty. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like to see people having difficulty. But if anybody has to have it, let it be them.\\nAnd I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be very interesting.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very proud to say that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gotten the most votes and also if you look at the overall primary the amount of votes cast, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also a record. So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve broken a lot of records in terms of the voters.\\nOur polling has come out and the polls are doing very well as you know. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re pretty much even and in some cases ahead of Hillary. And I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have a very, very successful number of months. And I think it will all culminate in November and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make America great. Okay?\\nSo that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way it is...\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m glad you asked the question because I have to tell you I have raised a tremendous amount of money for the vets \\xe2\\x80\\x93 almost $6 million. And more money is going to come in I believe over the next little while too.\\nBut I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve raised almost $6 million. All of the money has been paid out and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to give it to you in just a second.\\nIn fact, I brought a list just in case that question was asked.\\nBut the money has been paid out.\\nI have been thanked by so many veterans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 groups throughout the United States.\\nOne gentleman called me up recently crying that out of a blue he got a check for $100,000. I have been thanked by so many groups \\xe2\\x80\\x93 great veterans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 groups.\\nAnd by the way, outside you have a few people picketing. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sent there by Hillary Clinton and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re picketing that the money wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sent. The money has all been sent.\\nI wanted to keep it private. If we could, I wanted to keep it private because I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anybody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business if I want to send money to the vets.\\nBut I have to say this. I raised close to $6 million. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll probably be over that amount when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all said and done. But as of this moment, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s $5.6 million.\\nWhen this started, it started with a speech in Iowa when I said let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s raise some money for the vets and it went up from $1 million to $2 million to $3 million. And it now ends up to be almost $6 million and again I think we can even do better than that.\\nBut I will say that the press should be ashamed of themselves.\\nAnd behalf of the vets, the press should be ashamed of themselves. They are calling me. They are furious because I sent people checks of a lot of money.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to give you the names right now, which is what you want.\\nAnd instead of being like \"Thank you very much, Mr. Trump\" or \"Trump did a good job\", everyone said, \"Who got it? Who got it? Who got it?\" And you make me look very bad.\\nI have never received such bad publicity for doing such a good job.\\nSo I will give the names because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what you want. Right?\\nOkay. Are you ready?\\nI brought them here. It takes \\xe2\\x80\\x93 because you have to vet each company. You know, much of this money was paid out fairly early.\\nBut you have to vet all of these different groups because these are many different groups. You have to go through a process. When you send checks for hundreds of thousands of dollars to people and to companies and to groups that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never heard of \\xe2\\x80\\x93 charitable organizations. You have to vet it. You send people out. You do a lot of work.\\nNow, most of the money went out quite a while ago. Some of it went out more recently. But all of this has gone out and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll give you the names.\\nAre you ready? Do you have your pad?\\nAnd again, I really think the press \\xe2\\x80\\x93 look, the media, you know my opinion of the media. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very low. I think the media is frankly made up of people that, in many cases, not in all cases, are not good people. But I think this is an example.\\nAnd I just on behalf of all of the folks that have worked hard on this and all of the people that have made contributions, including myself; I gave $1 million, but I just want to tell you that there are so many people that are so thankful for what we did.\\nOne other thing that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important to know. Zero dollars have been taken out for administration.\\nYou know, when you go to a lot of these different groups, in this case, zero dollars have been taken out for administration. So a lot of these companies that make a lot of money doing the administration stuff. So no money \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it costs zero dollars to accumulate all of this money. Okay?\\nSo you have 22 Kill and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s $200,000.\\nAnd you can call these people. That was another thing. A lot of the money when it was sent out, different people would call. I could tell you, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to mention anybody specifically, but there were a couple of people that were really disgusting. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99d call and these vet groups they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get a lot of calls from the press. And maybe some of them would keep quiet or they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know or they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to talk to the press or they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel comfortable.\\nSo if they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say they got the money, which they all did, 100% got the money. All certified checks. If anyone wants to see the certified checks.\\nBut rather than say why don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you \\xe2\\x80\\x93 could I see a certified check? They said \"Well, they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say they got the money.\" They all got the money.\\nBut they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not people that always talk to the press. Many of them do talk to the press. Many of them have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I guess you found $2 million or $2.5 million where they talked.\\nWell, the number is $5.6 million and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to possibly go above that because I believe some other people are coming in.\\nReady?\\n22Kill got $200,000.\\nNow, these are checks that have been delivered, that have been cashed, that are now being used to help the vets.\\nAchilles International \\xe2\\x80\\x93 great organization \\xe2\\x80\\x93 $200,000. Much of this money was paid a long time ago.\\nAmerican Hero Adventures \\xe2\\x80\\x93 $100,000.\\nAmericans for Equal Living \\xe2\\x80\\x93 $100,000.\\nAmerica\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Vetdogs \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The Veterans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 K-9 Corps Inc. \\xe2\\x80\\x93 $75,000.\\nAMVETS \\xe2\\x80\\x93 $75,000.\\nJust so you understand. When I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do the Fox debate...because I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think they treated me right but actually they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been extremely fair over the last three or four months, I have to say that about Fox. But when I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that one event, the debate, I gave a speech. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to do this with the money for the vets but I decided to because I thought it would be a good idea.\\nAnd I had some very generous people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Carl Icahn gave $500,000. Phil Ruffin gave $1 million...Ike Perlmutter gave $1 million. We raised a lot of money. And I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to do that. It would have been easier just to give the speech.\\nAnd the problem with the press what they do is they convince people like me not to do it, not to give money to different things because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot easier actually that way.\\nAnd I believe we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have some more coming in. Some friends of mine, some more coming in. And that adds up to $5,600,000 total and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have some more coming in.\\nNow, every one of those checks have been passed other than the one check which is being held subject to they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting a final approval from the government. But every one of those has been passed.\\nThis is my check for $1 million.\\nWe have many letters from the different groups thanking us very much for the money and they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ask \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ask people to be here today. I could have asked every one of the group unlike Hillary who asks people to stand outside and say \"Donald Trump didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give the money.\"\\nNobody gave this kind of money.\\nSo I gave $5,600,000. More is coming in. Probably tops the $6 million number.\\nI never thought we were going to raise $1 million when we started. And we end up doing almost $6 million.\\nI have to tell you the press is so dishonest and so unfair.\\nA lot of the people behind me and some of the people over here helped in vetting the various requests for money. And I just want to thank all of those people.\\nI wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t too involved in picking the organizations other than to the Marine Law Enforcement. They are fabulous people. They honored me last year at the Waldorf Astoria. I knew them.\\nI was going to give it to three companies or three groups and we couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t vet them quickly. And so I gave it to the Marine.\\nAnd if you look at number, the Marine Corps Law Enforcement Foundation is a fabulous group and I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to go through a big vetting process with them. Because I was going to split the $1 million check up amongst...and in the end I just didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to go through the process of having to vet all those different groups.\\nBecause I wanted to make this out of the goodness of my heart. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to do this where the press is all involved and all of a sudden everybody is going \"Where did it go? Who did it go to?\" Then we said who it went to, then we said how much was it.\\n...Look, when this started...I said if we could raise $1 million that would be good. And we ended up raising almost $6 million. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to have more coming in over a period of time.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m totally accountable but I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to have credit for it.\\nActually though what I got was worse than credit because they were questioning me. And this is money. And by the way, most of that money went out very early just so you understand. But a lot of these groups \\xe2\\x80\\x93 getting vetted by, you know, when you pay the money out, they need government documentation. They need a lot of different things.\\nPlus, we want to find out who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in the good group.\\nI had people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 teams of people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 reviewing statistics, reviewing numbers and also talking to people in the military to find out whether or not the group was deserving of the money.\\nWe have given to groups that are unbelievable groups. And honestly, I wish you could hear the phone calls and see the letters. They are so happy. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m happy to do it. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want the credit for it but it was very unfair that the press treated us so badly.\\nWell, generally speaking, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 100% true.\\nI like scrutiny. But you know what? When I raise money \\xe2\\x80\\x93 excuse me, excuse me, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve watched you on television. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a real beauty. When I raise money for the veterans and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a massive amount of money \\xe2\\x80\\x93 find out how much Hillary Clinton has given to the veterans \\xe2\\x80\\x93 nothing.\\nAnd then I see a few guys standing out there. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re there for. They have no idea. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re there because Hillary Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign sent them.\\nAnd actually I think it was you or one of you that found out that they actually were with Hillary Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign, which was interesting but I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t surprised.\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want the credit for it but I shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be lambasted.\\nAnd remember this: So out of the almost $6 million that was raised not one penny did I take for administration cost. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unheard of.\\nHow else am I going to raise the money? How else am I going to raise the money?\\nI would have given \\xe2\\x80\\x93 just so you understand. Until I was criticized \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the only one in the world that could raise almost $6 million for the veterans, have uniform applause by the veterans\\xe2\\x80\\x99 groups, and end up being criticized by the press.\\nYes, I made a speech and during the speech I said, \"Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s raise a little money for the vets.\" It turned out to be a lot of money, not a little money. I thought if we could get to $1 million, it would be great, which it would have been.\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right. I do raise millions.\\nNo, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think so.\\nNo, I raised almost $6 million. Some of it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come through. But more money is coming through than didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come through. The number probably is going to be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 when we finish it probably going to be over the $6 million.\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind it coming from the opposition...What I do mind is when I raise all of these millions and when we started out nobody ever thought it was going to be over $5 million or close to $6 [million].\\nSo, look, here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the story. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the story. I think and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been dealing with the press a long time. I think the political press is among the most dishonest people I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever met, I have to tell you that. Okay?\\n...But I think the political press...I think the political press \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I see the stories and I see the way they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re attached.\\nFor instance, I went down this weekend to do Rolling Thunder. I was invited. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have anything to do with it. We had a tremendous gathering of people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 thousands \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how many thousands \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but many thousands of people. And I joked \"Oh, I thought we were going to go from the Jefferson Memorial to the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \" I was joking. They said \"Donald Trump was disappointed\". Everybody knew I was being sarcastic and joking. They said some of them. Said Donald Trump was very disappointed that it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go from Jefferson to Lincoln. You know, millions of people.\\nI was joking. I said \"Oh, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m used to watching it. We had \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \" I was joking. So they put it down as serious. They know I was joking.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll give you another example. We had a certain \\xe2\\x80\\x93 same event \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it was roped off where you could only get so many people there and there were a lot of people. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know \\xe2\\x80\\x93 10,000, 15,000, maybe 25,000. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know there was a lot of people. Plus there were people breaking the seams all the way along.\\nEugene Washington, a man I like actually, wrote an article said there were 5,000 people there. There were many times that. And you weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t allowed to have any more people.\\nAnd all of these people were with their motorcycles in parking lots all the way. They were waving to me as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going.\\nBut wait a minute. The point is law enforcement \\xe2\\x80\\x93 these people didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t allow you to have any more people.\\n...I had a tremendous crowd but it was the biggest crowd you could have had. It was all cordoned off. You weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t allowed to have any more. You weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t allowed to have any more people than that.\\nSo instead of saying Trump made a speech in front of a packed crowd, they said \"Trump was disappointed\" because I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have millions of people going from Jefferson to Washington. I mean, give me a break.\\n...Honestly, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dishonest reporting.\\nWell, the veterans believe me. Let me tell you, the veterans why they believe. And I have group that I gave...[invites a veteran to speak]\\n...I could have asked all these groups \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he just showed up. I just saw him. But I could have asked all these groups to come here and they could have made \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to do that.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not looking for credit. But what I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want is when I raise millions of dollars have people say like this sleazy guy over here from ABC \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a sleaze in my book. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a sleaze because you know the facts and you know the facts well.\\nVeteran:\\nThank you, Mr. Trump.\\nFirst of all for the record, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a state representative from New Hampshire, 10 years on the veterans affairs committee, 22 years in the Marine Corps, retired First Sergeant.\\nWhat I want to clarify here first of all, I would never ever in a million years put my name on a candidate that did not from his heart look me in the eye and tell me he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s concerned about veterans. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Donald Trump. I met him over a year ago.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been involved in many fundraisers. There are many scammers out there. He did the right thing by vetting these groups there.\\nIf you look at some of the groups, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re given 20 cents, 40 cents on the dollar and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re spending the rest for you know their nice lavish trips. He gave 100%.\\nThe liberal media is the only ones that have been calling the foundation. All right? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a former chairman. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been dealing with this stuff for years as a veterans activist.\\nStop using veterans as a political pawns. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a guy outside...go do a Google search on his Facebook. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s out there. His pictures with Clinton.\\nThey are using veterans as political pawns. It must stop.\\nDonald Trump is doing this with a heart. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all focused on the way he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s raising money and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not looking at the 22 veterans that are killing each other everyday. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not concerned about the thousands of veterans that are on waitlists.\\nLook at his plans on his Trump website. He talks about medical cards. He talks about fixing the VA. He talks about competition.\\nI think the liberal media and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been dealing with you a long time. You need to get your head out of your butt. Focus on the real issues.\\nThank you.\\nWhat I did \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ask Al. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gotten to know Al a little bit primarily through New Hampshire where we had great victories. But he showed up this morning because he was upset.\\nAnd many of the other groups were upset. They received $100,000 in the mail. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know what it was for. It was from me. Other groups received $200,000, $250,000. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what it was for.\\nAnd again, upstairs I have received phones calls with people crying. I have received letters \\xe2\\x80\\x93 heartfelt letters.\\n...The bad part about the dishonesty of the media is that people like me will be inclined not to do it anymore. Because why should you raise $5.6 million and I think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go over $6 million pretty easily. Nobody said that we started this out as a small little project where it was less than $1 million because it kept just mushrooming and building and building. But nobody talks about that.\\nSo we raised $5.6 million. We have so many happy groups. So many happy veterans.\\nAnd then I see these Hillary Clinton people outside. Now, of course, they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know the extent. They probably figured based on reading the press that Trump didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make, you know, didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t raise this kind of money.\\nBut we raised a lot and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be raising more and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be sending it to other people as we get along.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a complicated process.\\nNo, it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t...You know, the government sort of approves different groups for a lot of reasons. So it really does \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and more than anything else, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also speaking to other veterans. We have a circle of veterans. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to send a $250,000 check to a group that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do good work. So it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called vetting. We vet the vets. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called vetting.\\nI think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bothersome because I love the vets and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve worked hard for the vets. And as you can see, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve given a lot of money and raised a lot of money for the vets.\\nAnd I think when the press portrays it differently, the press is being very dishonest. So I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like that. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like dishonesty.\\nJeff Sessions is a fantastic man. Jeff Sessions is one of the most highly respected people in the United States Senate.\\nJeff Sessions is a person that I believe that Ted Cruz has the most respect for and I think Ted thought that he would get an endorsement.\\nYou know, Jeff Sessions has never endorsed a presidential candidate before as many years as he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been in the Senate.\\nSo you know, Jeff Sessions is certainly somebody that I would consider. Absolutely. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a fantastic person.\\nI think it was a very tough call. It was amazing because there were moments with the gorilla the way he held that child that almost like a mother holding a baby \\xe2\\x80\\x93 looks so beautiful and calm. And there were moments where it looked pretty dangerous. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think they had a choice. I mean, probably they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a choice.\\nYou have a child, a young child, at stake. You know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too bad there wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t another way.\\nI thought it was so beautiful to watch that powerful almost 500 pound gorilla and the way he dealt with that little boy. But it just takes one second. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one second \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not like it takes place over \\xe2\\x80\\x93 well, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to do it 30 seconds from now. It just takes one little flick of his finger. And I will tell you they probably had no choice.\\n...\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m entirely in favor of fixing the VA health care. VA is one of the great catastrophes in this country what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on.\\nYou look at what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening in Phoenix and different places throughout the country where they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re catching people stealing and they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even fire them, where people are waiting five days, six days, seven days on line. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re dying while they wait on line.\\nAnd I am in favor of if they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get to a doctor within a reasonable period of time, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to see a doctor and the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to pay for it. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to go to a private doctor or a public hospital and a public doctor but some place that can take them immediately. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re losing thousands of people waiting on line.\\nAnd the Veterans Administration is run by Obama just as incompetently as he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s running our country.\\nYou look at the TSA, you look at what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on at the airports and you look at that. Okay? Just take a look at that. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like the Veterans Administration.\\nNothing in our country works anymore. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a mess.\\nAnd maybe that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing so well in the polls.\\nNo, it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to be privatization. No, it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to be privatization. What it has to be is when somebody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on line and they say it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be a seven day wait, that person is going to walk over to across the street to a private doctor, be taken care of. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to pay the bill.\\nAnd by the way, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be a lot less expensive. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll check it out and be careful. But that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be a lot less expensive than what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on.\\nThese people are living in hell.\\nAnd Hillary Clinton said the Veterans Administration is working just fine. And the head of it, [Bob] McDonald said last week that waiting in line is not bad \\xe2\\x80\\x93 look at Disney World. Okay? These are the kind of people we have running things. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ridiculous.\\n...That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s their choice. You have a party called the Democrats and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have to make that choice. I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably going to be her because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rigged.\\nAnd I think if you people will say I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the one that came up with the term \"rigged\". I used it for myself, except that I won by such big margins that the whole system is rigged on both sides. With the Republicans it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s less obvious. With Democrats with the whole super delegate thing, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ridiculous.\\nSo I think that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have to make that determination.\\nIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re asking me who I prefer running against?\\nI think what she did was very bad and I think a lot of people have done a lot less than her and their lives have been destroyed.\\nThe judge has been very unfair. Has not done a good job. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been a very bad judge. Has been very unfair. And I will win the Trump University case. I already am as far as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m concerned. But I will win the Trump University case.\\nBecause I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care...\\nI have a judge who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very, very unfair.\\nWell, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see it in court documents. But I have a judge who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very, very unfair. He knows he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unfair. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll win the Trump University case. I can settle that case. I could have settled it. I just choose not to.\\nIn fact, when I ran this, they said why didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you settle up that case? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to settle the case.\\nBecause you know what? Because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a man of principle. And most of the people that took those courses have letters saying they thought it was great essentially. It was good. It was great.\\nAnd you know what? When they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re on the stand and you say \"How come you signed the letter saying that Trump University was so good? How come you signed the letter?\"\\nThe woman that was the original plaintiff in the case \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they went to the court and the judge allowed her to get out of the case. The case should have been dropped. The whole case should have been dropped.\\nThey wanted her dismissed from the case. You know why? Because she was deposed, she was such a bad witness that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d win the case easily. She signed a letter and she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on film. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on tape like these cameras saying unbelievably good things about Trump University. So they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want her anymore because she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a disaster for them.\\nSo they went to the judge and they said \"Your honor, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to have her not be a participant, not be a plaintiff in the case.\" And he said, \"Oh, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s okay.\" She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the one that started the case.\\nNow, they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even want her to testify. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want her to testify because she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a disaster. She has all sorts of beautiful statements about it. And importantly, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on tape saying how great it is. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want her. I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want her either.\\nNow, I could have settled that case. I could settle that case. I can settle that case. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go through the process.\\nBecause we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re down the line. Because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re down the line and the fact that you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win as independent. For the most part, you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even get on Texas and various other states now. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too late. But Texas is out.\\n...Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what happens. What happens is you will not have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and very importantly \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you will not have Supreme Court justices. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to lose. You could have as many as four or five. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s over.\\nNow, [Bill] Kristol\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the one that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the last one. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget, he said \"Trump will never run.\" The guy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a smart person. He said, \"Donald Trump would never run.\" Remember?\\nYou remember? I actually blame you. Why do you put this guy on television? I see him on the different shows. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got no credibility. Said I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t run. If I run, I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do well. If I do well, this and that. He looks like such a fool.\\nI saw him on one show. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s practically crying because he can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t justify.\\nNow he comes out with a tweet over the weekend \\xe2\\x80\\x93 over Memorial Day weekend \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it sounds like he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to put somebody up. Even I thought it. I thought, \"Oh, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to find indie.\"\\nNow he comes out with something saying he was almost \\xe2\\x80\\x93 almost \\xe2\\x80\\x93 kidding. Okay?\\nLet me tell you, these people are losers. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trying to make you \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trying to drive you guys a little bit nuts.\\nIf they do an indie, assuming it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decent, which I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think anybody with a reputation would do it because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d look like fools. But what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do is you lose the election for the Republicans and therefore you lose the Supreme Court, therefore you will have a group of people put on the Supreme Court where this country will never ever recover. It will never, ever be the same.\\nNo, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say that. I said Bill Kristol is a loser and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you why...He has called every single move. Take a look \\xe2\\x80\\x93 on me, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to lose this state \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I won in a landslide...I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say everybody. Many. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say everybody.\\nWait, wait, wait. Bill Kristol is a loser. His magazine is failing, as you know. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be down \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it even survives. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s getting some free publicity.\\nBut Bill Kristol \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been watching this for two years. \"Trump isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to run.\" Then I go into a race, we go into New Hampshire. \"Oh, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to win New Hampshire.\" I win in a landslide. Every place I went I was not going to win. But I win in a landslide. Do you think maybe he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like me?\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrong. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrong. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get 30%.\\nMy last score was 78%. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get 30%.\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. No, no, no.\\nHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way I look at it.\\nWhen I have somebody that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not on my side, when you know \\xe2\\x80\\x93 by the way, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gotten great applause from the press in terms of as an achievement because the Republican Party is really well unified.\\nWe have come up. People that you would have never thought possible are now saying, \"I support Trump.\" So remember that. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk about that too much.\\nBut actually last week, the big story was how fast the Republican Party is healing because it is a healing process. It was a rough \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that was a rough campaign...\\nI can this. The real is how fast we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting together.\\nNow, if I have a Republican who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not on my side, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 why should I be particularly nice to that person? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to go after it like I would Hillary or Crazy Bernie. But you know what? Why should I be nice to that person if I have a person that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to support me? I have no obligation.\\nPolitically, I may be right. I may be wrong. But that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s who I am. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a very honest person...\\nIf somebody is going to say a little bit negative or a lot negative about me and if they happen to be Republican, I may choose to hit them back. Not always. But I may choose to hit them back.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not a fan of Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney lost an election he should have won.\\nAnd if you read the front page of the Wall Street Journal about Mitt Romney, he looks like a fool.\\nLook, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not a fan of Mitt Romney. Just so you understand. I raised a lot of money for Mitt Romney. I made robocalls for Mitt Romney. I made speeches for him. He let us down.\\nIf you read the front page of the Wall Street Journal this weekend, Mitt Romney looks like a fool.\\nNow, what would I say good about Mitt Romney?\\nShe was not nice and I was fine, just a little bit of a jab. But she wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t nice. And you think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to change? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not changing, including with her.\\nBob Dole is a fan of mine. Bob Dole endorsed me. So don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell me about Bob Dole.\\nWell, look, Gary Johnson, he got 1% of the vote last time. I watched that whole situation. It was pretty disgraceful. I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a total fringe deal. I think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a fringe candidate if you want to know the truth. I look at him and I watch him and I watch his motions and I watch what he says. I think that he is a fringe candidate...when you do a little research on that I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to be a factor. Okay?\\nNo, not all of you. Just many of you.\\nYeah, it is. Yeah, it is. Let me tell you something. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a person \\xe2\\x80\\x93 yeah, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be like this...If the press writes false stories like they did with this \\xe2\\x80\\x93 half of you were amazed that I raised all of this money. If the press writes false stories like they did where I wanted to keep a low profile. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want the credit for raising all this money for the vets. I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t looking for the credit.\\nAnd by the way, more money is coming in. I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t looking for the credit.\\nBut I had no choice but to do this because the press was saying I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t raise any money for them.\\nNot only did I raise it, much of it was given a long time ago. And there is a vetting process and I think you understand that.\\nBut when I raise almost $6 million and probably in the end will raise more than six because more is going to come in and is coming in. But when I raise $5.6 million as of today, more is coming in. And this is going to phenomenal groups.\\nAnd I have many of these people vetting the people getting the money and working hard. And then we have to read probably libelous stories or certainly close in the newspapers and the people know the stories are false, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to continue to attack the press.\\nLook, I find the press to be extremely dishonest. I find the political press to be unbelievably dishonest. I will say that.\\nOkay, thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.\\nWell, thank you very much everyone.\\nI want to start by, as always, thanking my family. My wife, Melania. My kids \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not kids anymore but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re kids as far as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m concerned. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll always be my kids. And I want to thank my great parents who are looking down right now and my brother looking down on us. I want to thank my entire family, including Maryanne, Elizabeth, Robert.\\nAnd it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been some unbelievable day and evening and year. I never have been through anything like this but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a beautiful thing to watch and a beautiful thing to behold, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make America great again. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make America great again.\\nSo important \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so important that the people of Indiana have been incredible.\\nI started as you know not very long ago \\xe2\\x80\\x93 about six weeks ago \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I was told that I had a 20 point deficit.\\nAnd I went there and I worked very hard and I campaigned and I made lots of speeches and met lots of incredible people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 incredible people. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get better, and the crowds got bigger and bigger. And toward the end, it was like I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to leave. I almost said, \"Maybe I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll just never leave\" and it resonated somehow and we have a tremendous victory tonight.\\nIt was a tremendous victory.\\nAnd I have to thank Bobby Knight. Boy, Bobby Knight was incredible. He was incredible.\\nI always that people like that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t many \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called tough, smart, and they know how to win. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what our country needs. We have to win again. We have to know how to win.\\nAnd we haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t won. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been losing all the time. We lose with our military. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t beat ISIS. We lose with trade. We lose with borders. We lose everything.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to lose. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to start winning again and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win big league. Believe me.\\nSo when I got back tonight and I started watching all of the different networks, I could immediately that we were doing very well, and it really looks like a massive victory and it looks like we win all 57 delegates.\\nAnd I must say in staying in various places in Indiana, I turned on the television and all I saw was negative ads, negative one after another after another.\\nAnd I called my people and I said, \"How can we win? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just constantly.\" It was the same as in Florida. You know, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been 60,000 negative ads.\\nI got it right from you folks, okay? 60,000. In fact, two weeks ago it was 55,000. Now it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 60,000 negative ads \\xe2\\x80\\x93 most of which are absolutely false and disgusting. And I said how can anybody endure this?\\nI had one evening two nights ago where literally they had five ads on in between segments of a show that I was watching. And I said that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just incredible.\\nAnd the people are so smart. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t buy it. They get it.\\nAnd it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tremendous, tremendous amounts of money were spent \\xe2\\x80\\x93 millions and millions of dollars. And they were comparing it. They think it was probably $8 million was spent against me and we spent $900,000. So, I mean, to me that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supposed to be. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something that makes me feel really, really very good.\\nAnd now we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to Nebraska where I have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I just hear we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing really wonderfully. I look forward to that very much.\\nAnd West Virginia. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get those miners back to work. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get those miners back to work.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to be Hillary Clinton, and I watched her three or four weeks ago where she was talking about the miners as if they were just numbers and she was talking about she wants the mines closed and she will never let them work again.\\nLet me tell you, the miners in West Virginia and Pennsylvania which was so great to me last week and Ohio and all over, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to start to work again. Believe me. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be proud again to be miners.\\nSo we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be going there. I must say this tremendous run that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had started with New York when we had almost 62%. And don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s with three people. So 62% with two people is a massive landslide. But 63% almost \\xe2\\x80\\x93 just a little over 62% \\xe2\\x80\\x93 when you have that kind of a number with three people, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actually unheard of.\\nAnd all throughout, it was 17 people, then 15, then 12, you know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tremendous, and we were getting very high numbers. And some of the numbers in my opinion that I got in the early stages were in a state with 32% but there were 14 people. I think that might actually be more and better than getting 62% in New York. But we never got the credit for that.\\nBut now we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need the credit because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going after Hillary Clinton. She will not be a great president. She will not be a good president. She will be a poor president.\\nShe doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand trade. Her husband signed perhaps in the history of the world the single worst trade deal ever done. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called NAFTA.\\nAnd I was witnessed to the carnage over the last six weeks especially. Now I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve known Syracuse and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve known Poughkeepsie and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve known all of the different places that I visited in New York and then Pennsylvania and then Maryland, which treated me so great the people are incredible.\\nAnd all of the different state \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Connecticut. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve witnessed what it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s done really firsthand. And it has been indeed carnage.\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to change it around.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to let Carrier and all of these companies just think they can move \\xe2\\x80\\x93 go to another country, make their products, sell it back to us, and we get only one thing: We get unemployment. Not going to happen anymore, folks. Not going to happen anymore.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to bring back our jobs and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to keep our jobs. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to let companies leave.\\nNow, if they want to go to a different state, good luck, compete.\\nBut when they start going to different countries and in many cases countries that devalue their currency and make it impossible for our companies to compete, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen. Not going to happen.\\nAnd if they want to do it anyway, there will be consequences, and there will be very, very serious consequences.\\nI have to tell you that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve competed all my life. Competitive person. All my life I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been in competitions. Different competitions whether it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sports or business or now for 10 months politics.\\nAnd I have to tell you that I have met some of the most incredible competitors that I have ever competed against right here on the Republican Party.\\nYou know, we started off with that 17 number. And just so you understand \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Ted Cruz \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if he likes me or if he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like me. But he is one hell of a competitor. He is a tough, smart guy.\\nAnd he has got an amazing future. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got an amazing future. So I want to congratulate Ted.\\nAnd I know how tough it is. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tough. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tough.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had some moments where it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not looking so good, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a great feeling. And so I understand how Ted feels and Heidi and their whole beautiful family.\\nAnd I just want to say that one tough competitor and I can say that for the others. I mean, Chris Christie who endorsed me. Incredible guy. Dr. Ben Carson who was right up there, one of the first. He just called me and said, \"It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a movement you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got going. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to do something because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an incredible movement.\" And Dr. Ben Carson endorsed me. And I want to tell you that is an incredible man and we want to keep Ben totally involved because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win in November.\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win big and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be America first.\\nYou know, I made a speech the other day and I talked about how we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the policemen for the world, how we protect other countries and they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t respect us and they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take care of us and they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t treat us right in many cases.\\nAnd that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen.\\nNow, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to keep things going and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to keep things going very nicely but we owe \\xe2\\x80\\x93 soon \\xe2\\x80\\x93 $21 trillion. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s $19 trillion now but with a budget that was recently done, soon it will be $21 trillion.\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re just not in a position that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in 30 years ago, 40 years ago, 50 years ago when a lot of these things took place and began taking place.\\nSo, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have unbelievably good relationships with other countries.\\nBut likewise they have to treat us fairly and they have to understand that what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been doing over the years has been so wrong and so unfair to the United States, to its people, and to its taxpayers.\\nSo that will change. And I will tell you, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to end up liking us better than they do right. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to respect us.\\nIn this building right upstairs, I have the largest bank in the world from China. The relationship is fantastic.\\nWe have great relationships with many foreign countries. But they have to respect us and they have to understand where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re coming from.\\nAnd you know, it is a two-way street. And the two-way street means that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going down one side and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re coming up the other. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to meet and we are going to have something that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be really fabulous.\\nNow, if that can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen. If for some reason they want this system to continue the way it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going now, which is not fair and not good, where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re spending trillions and trillions of dollars probably $4 trillion in the Middle East.\\nAnd we have to build our infrastructure, our roads. We have to rebuild our bridges, our airports, our hospitals in this country.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve become close to a third world country. You look at some of our airports; it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s third world. And then you go to other countries and you see places like you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never seen.\\nSo I have to say that we are going to turn it around.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to build up our military bigger, better, stronger than ever before. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the cheapest thing we can do. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have to take out ISIS and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have to take them out fast. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t allow that cancer to continue. We cannot allow it to continue.\\nAnd you know, one group that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been so incredible to me are the vets \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the veterans. And they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been treated so badly. So badly. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get that straightened out.\\nNow, one of the things that just happened, which to me is very exciting and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happened now with two or three. But the Rasmussen poll came out yesterday and in that poll, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m now leading Hillary Clinton. A lot of good things...\\nAnd that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to continue because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to be able to do it, folks.\\nThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to be able to make great trade deals. We have such bad deals.\\nThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to be able to do what we do with the military.\\nThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to be able to do what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do on the border, including the wall.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have unbelievably great relationships with the Hispanics. The Hispanics have been so incredible to me. They want jobs. Everybody want jobs. The African-Americans want jobs. You look at what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on. They want jobs.\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to bring back our jobs. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to save our jobs and people are going to have great jobs again.\\nAnd this country, which is very, very divided in so many different ways is going to become one beautiful loving country. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to love each other. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to cherish each other. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take care of each other. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have great economic development.\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to let other countries take it away from us because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been happening for far too many years and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to do it anymore. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to do it anymore.\\nI want to thank and congratulate the Republican National Committee and Reince Priebus, who I just spoke to. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s doing a tremendous job. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not an easy job when he had 17 egos and now I guess he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s down to one.\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. Is there a second? I mean, is there a second? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know.\\nBut I have ask you folks to explain the status of that.\\nBut he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s done an amazing job and I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to see something really, really fantastic.\\nI also want to thank my staff, Paul, Cory, Pope. I mean, these people. What we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been doing has been incredible.\\nThe work has been unreal.\\nAnd Jared [Kushner], married to my daughter Ivanka. I mean, honestly, you know Jared is a very successful real estate person but I actually think he likes politics more than he likes real estate. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m excited. And he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very good at politics.\\nSo again folks this has been an amazing evening. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expect this. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expect it.\\nAnd what Ted did is really a very brave thing to do and a great thing to do because we want to bring unity to the Republican Party. We have to bring unity. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so much easier if we have it.\\nAnd many, many people are calling that you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even believe \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the media, the press, they wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe. People who have said the worst things about me \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never had things said about me like this.\\nYou know, with my businesses, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always been very respected. People didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk to me this way. But in politics, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy.\\nThe worst things and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re calling now and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re calling us all and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re saying, \"We\\xe2\\x80\\x99d love to get on the train\" \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the \"Trump Train\" they call it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d love to get on the team.\"\\nAnd I actually spoke to one today who was vicious. I mean, this guy was unbelievable. And I said, \"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d love having you and I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s terrific. But after what you said about me how can you possibly join our team?\" And he said, \"Mr. Trump, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even think about it. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry about it. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be no problem.\" In other words, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a politician; there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no problem. I would have had a hard time.\\nBut we have a lot of people coming \\xe2\\x80\\x93 lots of congressmen. I have to thank Jeff Sessions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Sen. Jeff Sessions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one of the most respected men or people in Congress.\\nAnd so many others. I mean, Sarah Palin has been from day one incredible.\\nJerry Falwell, Jr. Liberty University, I mean he is something. He is really a special person. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done an incredible job and everybody goes through Liberty. We all go through Liberty and somehow he liked what I was saying and perhaps he liked the way I said it. But he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a special guy and he really has helped. And so many pastors and ministers.\\nAnd tonight, I see that I won with the evangelicals. The evangelical vote was for Trump.\\nAnd there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no greater honor. No greater honor. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to work together for many, many years. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make it so good. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be saying Merry Christmas again. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be saying it...\\nAnd I won with women. I love winning with women. But I won with women. I won with men. We won with Hispanics. We won with African-Americans. We won with every \\xe2\\x80\\x93 virtually every category. So it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just been an amazing evening.\\nSo again, I want to congratulate Ted Cruz. He is a tough, smart competitor. I want to thank my wife and my family. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an incredible family.\\nI want to thank my staff \\xe2\\x80\\x93 both my staff and my thousands and thousands of people that work for the Trump organization, and perhaps in all fairness more importantly on this evening and for what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing currently, my staff where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re running for the presidency.\\nAnd remember this. Our theme is very simple. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s make America great. We will make America great again. We will start winning again. You will be so proud of this country very, very soon.\\nThank you all. Thank you very much. Thank you! Thank you very much!\\nSo beautiful. She said, \"Do you mind? I wrote something \\xe2\\x80\\x93 coming out, I wrote something. Do you mind if I said it?\" I said, \"Not at all. Should I read it?\" She said, \"I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want you to read it. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want you to read it.\"\\nThank you very much. I want to thank Melania for that. That was very special.\\nYou know, Wisconsin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a really special place, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been all over today. Speeches all over. We had one before. Thousands and thousands of people standing outside of an airplane hangar because the hangar was packed. And we had another one in the morning, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been an amazing day, and some phenomenal results.\\nYou see what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening with the polls. Boom! Like a rocket ship. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like a rocket.\\nI guess I just heard when I walked in one just came out that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re 10 points up. But don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry about that. Pretend you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hear that. Go out and vote tomorrow. Okay? Go out and vote tomorrow.\\nYou know, I always tell \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I used to say this to politicians that run that\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be friends of mine, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d say, \"Pretend you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a little bit behind. Okay? That way you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d work hard. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99d never forget.\"\\nBut you know, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s somebody that was \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I saw just a little while ago in the audience a very special woman, an incredible woman, and Melania just said hello and met her was so taken, and she represented you so beautifully. And some of you know who she is. Many of you know who she is.\\nBut she was Miss Wisconsin. She has one of the most incredible spirits that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got her husband and her son and her son is absolutely magnificent and she loves him more than anything that you can imagine.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an amazing and just an incredible story and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make sure that it goes as well as it can.\\nShe was so amazing the way she walked up here and just spoke from the heart, and we all have to speak from the heart.\\nAnd you noticed no teleprompters? We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have teleprompters. We want to do it right from here and from here and from here.\\nBut I just want to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I saw Melissa, and I said, \"I have to have you up\" because her story\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an amazing story and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a story of courage and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to work with her family and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make sure everything goes well.\\nOkay, thank you all very much.\\nSo, in coming over today and in going through a few of them, I said to a few of the folks I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to explain what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening because our country is being decimated by stupidity, by bad deals, by horrible trades, by TPP, which Cruz wants badly and which is going to destroy Wisconsin.\\nThis Trans-Pacific Partnership is a disaster. Cruz is pushing it hard.\\nKasich, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a player here. I mean, the guy is one in 32. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one and it was in his own state. And if I would have campaigned there two more days instead of staying in Florida, I would have won in my opinion Ohio. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one and 32.\\nNow, in all fairness, Jeb Bush was doing a lot better than that. Many people were doing better. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called you get out. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s taking my votes. We have to get over 50%. And how do you do that?\\nLook, at a certain point in life, what you do is you say, \"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m one in 32. In other words, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve won one out of 32 states,\" and you do what Marco did, which was great, and you do what Rand Paul did, and you do what a lot of them did, and you get out.\\nAnd she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going through a very hard time. And she has been so supportive and so like just incredible of what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re trying to do. Not me. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a messenger. What we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re trying to do \\xe2\\x80\\x93 make America great again and bring it back and stop letting the world take advantage of us both militarily and we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win anymore.\\nWe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win anymore. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win with trade. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win with the military.\\nWe pay for everybody else\\xe2\\x80\\x99s military.\\nWe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing.\\nAnd she saw it and she was here early. And she knows that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take care of our people, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be America first. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to be America first. We have no choice. We have no choice.\\nAnd she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s with a friend of hers who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very well-known, Chelsea Cooley, who is a tremendous, tremendous woman and just an amazing person. Also a great singer but I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even mention that because Chelsea would be the last to want to have people know that. Chelsea is such a great friend of Melissa Young and Melissa Young \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I just want to bring her and Chelsea onto the stage and maybe Melissa would like to say something and Chelsea. But this is just an unbelievable woman.\\nSo could I ask Melissa to come up on stage please?\\nAnd by the way, if you want, you could put your name up and you say \"I want to run\" and you go to the convention and you run.\\nBut it would be nice to see \\xe2\\x80\\x93 because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what, he takes my votes away much more than he does Cruz. And I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like it. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appropriate.\\nBut you know what? If we have to live with him, we still beat him easily. Okay, folks? I mean, okay?\\nBut Kasich voted for NAFTA. NAFTA was a disaster for Wisconsin and it was a disaster for our country.\\nTed Cruz wants TPP and it is going to make NAFTA look like peanuts. What they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing to us with those documents, and Cruz is the one that insisted that we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk about money manipulation, which is devaluation of currencies in the agreement. He wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let them do it. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the one that fought currency devaluation. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the single biggest tool that other countries have for taking our business, taking our money, and taking our jobs. And we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let this go on any longer.\\nNow, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re controlled by their PACs. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re controlled by the people that put up their campaign contributions. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re controlled, you know, with the lobbyists in Washington. They have signs on their forehead. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like stamped into their forehead \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"I take care of Cruz.\" They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re specialists. \"I take care of Kasich.\" \"I take care of Hillary.\"\\nOh, Hillary. Ayeyeye. \"Take care of Hillary.\"\\nSo we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let it happen anymore. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let it happen anymore.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know Obama used to say, \"Time for change\"? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time for change but real change this time not that change. Real change.\\nObama yesterday \\xe2\\x80\\x93 President Obama yesterday for the first time he started having reservations about the Iran deal. I could have told him that six months ago, nine months ago, long before it was signed. The ink isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even dry and now he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s finally starting to understand it was a big beautiful mistake and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only going to get worse.\\nAnd by the way, Iran is getting worse. They were supposed to come into the community. Remember? What a bunch of babies. Are we babies? Are we babies? Hello over there.\\nThey were supposed to come into the community and they were supposed to, you know, get involved.\\nNow, you see they just ordered 118 Airbus jets. Those are the big jets. 100. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t order Boeing.\\nThe reason \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one of the reasons is we restrict them from spending. So we give them $150 billion and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not even allowed to give us money by investing, by buying our products. Okay? How crazy are we? How much longer is it going to last? When are we going to get smart? When are we going to stop?\\nWe as a country are being ripped off. We are being ripped off by virtually every single country in the world. Okay? Whether it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s militarily or trade.\\nWe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win anymore. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win with the military. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t beat ISIS.\\nCan you imagine Gen. MacArthur or Gen. George Patton? They say get rid of ISIS. What do you think?\\n...It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so sad to see what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening to our country and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to turn it around and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to change it. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make it rich again, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make it strong again.\\nSo, and so many different elements, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been talking about trade. I always talk about trade.\\nBecause when I announced on June 16th coming down the escalator with Melania, it was like the Academy Awards. There were so many cameras; I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never seen anything like it. So many cameras. And I took a deep breadth and I said, \"Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go.\" Because we have to do it.\\nYou know, it takes guts. Running for president, believe me, takes guts. It takes a lot of guts. Believe me.\\nAnd even for the politicians they run at least they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re out on the line, and then you see the dishonesty. You see where I won Louisiana and then I find out that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not supposed to get as many delegates as the person that I beat. What kind of stuff is that?\\nAnd somebody said, \"Well, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a rule and another rule.\" I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care about rules, folks. I go out and I campaign. We win. We win. We get the delegates. Right?\\nBut in the meantime, we have millions more votes than Cruz. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve beaten him in most of the states. I mean, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re just winning so much. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re winning by almost 300 delegates.\\nSo we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing great. And I think we close it out before the convention. I think we actually close it out before the convention.\\nAnd that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like a prizefighter. You know, they go into unfriendly territory, and the champ, he goes in. And they say, \"What do you think? You may have an unfriendly decision.\" He says, \"No, when you knock them out, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no unfriendly decision.\"\\nIf we get the delegates, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve pulled out a knock-out. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be, and I can see that happening because more and more people are calling, they want to get on board.\\nFrankly, when I looked at what happened \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a friend of mine, who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, one of my great friends, he lives right down \\xe2\\x80\\x93 not very far from here. And he said, \"With Wisconsin, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going win.\" I said, \"Well, what do you think? But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not seeing polls that are great. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a little bit down. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m down in some. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a little bit down.\" He says, \"No, no, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win. But you have to be there. You have to come in and you have to talk to the people.\" Like we did this afternoon at the hangar. And he said, \"You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win. I mean, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win.\" He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very smart guy, I want to tell you. Great guy. But he said, \"You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to come in.\"\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been making \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been making speeches, three today, four yesterday, three or four the other day. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re here constantly. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get so sick of me. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to say, \"Oh, get him the hell out of here.\"\\nNo, we are making so much progress and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been so inspiring to see the people. I mean, look at even you people. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sit down. If you want, you can. Oh, stay up. Stand up. What the heck? Hey, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got plenty of time to sit down, right? We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got plenty of time.\\nBut I do appreciate that. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a sign of affection, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a sign of respect, and I really do appreciate it. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really nice.\\nSo we have to bring our country back and so many different things.\\nWith China, we have a trade deficit of $500 billion a year.\\nWith Mexico, we will build a wall. We will have strong borders. Strong borders. Believe me. We have a trade deficit of $58 billion a year. The wall\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to cost $10 billion to build. And people, the politicians are saying, \"How can you possibly get them to pay?\"\\nLet me tell you something, folks. We have some good business people in this audience.\\nWhen you have a $58 billion deficit, and you have a $10 billion wall, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s real easy. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on a yearly basis the $58 billion. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really easy.\\nAnd they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand it. They said, \"How are you going to get them to pay?\"\\nI said, \"It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so easy.\" And you understand it. Just rely on me. Okay? Rely. So easy. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so easy. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have a strong border.\\nYou know, two days ago I was greatly honored because the Border Patrol, the folks that do a great job, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re told to stand back but they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to stand back. They want to do their job properly. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re proud people. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re incredible people. Frankly, before the wall goes up, we might not even need the wall, but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re building it anyway. Okay? We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re building it. Believe me.\\nBut the Border Patrol people are unbelievable people, and its 15,500 people gave me an endorsement two days ago. And I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ask for it. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know.\\nFirst time, first time they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever done it. Right? First time, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever done it and they gave me an endorsement. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so important.\\nNow, Sheriff Joe [Arpaio] from Arizona. You know, I won Arizona very big, and Sheriff Joe was with me and it was incredible and we love it.\\nLook, we have to have strong borders. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let the Syrians come in that we have no idea who they are, where they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re coming from. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re Syrians.\\nThis could be the all-time great Trojan horse. Who knows?\\nI have as big a heart as anybody. We want to help them. We want to build safe zones in Syria.\\nI want to get the Gulf States to pay for it. The Gulf States have nothing but money. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have money. We will run it. We will do a good job. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get it done but let somebody else pay for it for a change. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it.\\n...I keep getting these requests. You know, Al Green \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the great Al Green wrote \"The Snake\". How many people have heard \"The Snake\"? How many people? Oh, do you want to hear \"The Snake\"? Do you want to hear it? I mean, people love it and I love it because it says what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to happen to us if we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not careful.\\nAnd this really pertains to allowing people into our country that we know are going \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have problems. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have huge problems. Allowing people in from areas of the world we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know where they come from. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know where their documents are. They say they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have documents. They have no papers. No nothing. We let them in. How stupid can we be?\\nSo this is called \"The Snake\" and I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty good. All right? Are you ready for this? A couple of you have heard it but some of you haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\n\"On her way to work one morning, down the path along the lake, a tender-hearted woman saw a poor half-frozen snake. His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh well,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she cried, \\xe2\\x80\\x98I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take you in, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take care of you.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x98Take me in, oh tender woman. Take me in for heaven\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sake. Take me in, oh tender woman,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cried the broken snake. She wrapped him up all cozy in a curvature of silk and then laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk. Now she hurried home from work that night. As soon as she arrived, she found that pretty snake she\\xe2\\x80\\x99d taken in had been revived. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Take me in, oh tender woman. Take me in for heaven\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sake. Take me in, oh tender woman,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sighed the broken snake. Now she clutched him to her bosom. \\xe2\\x80\\x98You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re so beautiful,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 she cried. \\xe2\\x80\\x98But if I hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t brought you in by now, heaven\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sake you might have died.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Now she stroke his pretty skin and then she kissed him and held him tight. But instead of saying thank you, that snake gave her a vicious bite. \\xe2\\x80\\x98Take me in, oh tender woman. Take me in for heaven\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sake. Take me in, oh tender woman,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sighed the very, very healthy snake. \\xe2\\x80\\x98I saved you,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cried the woman, \\xe2\\x80\\x98And you bit me. Heaven\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why? You know your bite is poisonous and now I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to die.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x98Oh shut up, silly woman,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 said the reptile with a grin. \\xe2\\x80\\x98You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\"\\nRight?\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening to our country, folks. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening to our country and we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let it happen. We have to be smart. We have to be vigilant. We have to be strong. And if we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to have a country.\\nAnd we need borders and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have borders.\\nAnd we need great trade deals and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make great trade deals.\\nAnd we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let Mexico and I have great respect for Mexico and I respect their leaders but we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let Mexico and China and any country you want to name steal our business, steal our jobs.\\nWhen you look at what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening in Wisconsin \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and you see it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the reason I beat your governor and I beat him badly was I just read off the statistics. I just read \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all I did, I stood up and I read statistics. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re losing jobs...It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very average. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very average.\\nOur country is less than average. Okay? Our country is doing so badly. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just one of those things and we have to smarten up and we have to get really tough. We have to get so, so, so vigilant and not be so politically correct. We have to do what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right for our country.\\nWhen the great Ford Motor Company \\xe2\\x80\\x93 great company \\xe2\\x80\\x93 when they build a $2.5 billion plant in Mexico, when Nabisco moves its massive plant to Mexico from Chicago, we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let it happen.\\nWhen Carrier Air Conditioners, as you know, they just announced they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re moving to Mexico.\\nPfizer is moving to Ireland.\\nBut let me just tell you. So, I watched the politicians and they have no business instincts. But more importantly, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re taken care of.\\nYou know, a lot of friends come up to me and they say, \"Donald, let me ask you a question. These politicians \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are they really that dumb?\" I said, \"No, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not actually that dumb. Some are. But they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not actually that dumb. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all taken care of by the special interests. And when you want something done, you see certain people in Washington.\"\\nHey, who is better than me? I mean, take a look at me. I was before June 16th, I was a part of the establishment and they will do not what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right for you but they will do what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right for the company they represent or the country they represent and the United States continues to get ripped off, ripped off, ripped off.\\nAnd a lot of times, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say, \"How can a deal be so stupidly made? These people are so stupid.\" They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not stupid. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing it for themselves. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing it because they want campaign contributions. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing it because they want money put in their PACs. They are totally controlled by the money. Believe me. They are totally controlled by the money, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not good for our country. Okay? That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not good because terrible things are happening and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting weaker and weaker.\\nHundreds of thousands and even millions of jobs are being taken out.\\nYou look at the jobs we have. Even in Wisconsin, I mean, you see the jobs, the manufacturing, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all so down and so gloomy and throughout the United States. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a disaster what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on in our country. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to have jobs left.\\nAnd they do it with manipulation of currency. And they do it with guile. They do it with so many different elements that our people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening.\\nOur politicians in most cases don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening. And when they do know what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening and they let it happen, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s even worse.\\nSo I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not taking money from anybody. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m self-funding my campaign.\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get it. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get it.\\nNow, I look at this U.S. manufacturing \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I mean, just look at this. Look at these charts. I mean, you can see them...This is where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going.\\nYou know that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not good. Right? This is where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going.\\nThere was one that I just saw. Just got this. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like incredible.\\nLook at this. This is U.S. manufacturing jobs rapidly decline since year 2000. Look at that chart. Another couple of years, there won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be any jobs.\\nAnd the jobs we have now are bad jobs. These are bad jobs. These aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t good jobs. And everybody admits that. Even the other side says, \"We agree. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re bad jobs.\"\\nAnd the number that they talk about when they say 5% unemployment \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a fictitious number. When you stop looking for a job, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re considered statistically employed.\\nIt was a number that was made up years ago probably by president but certainly by politicians to make them look good, to make them look really good like the economy.\\nThe economy is not good. The economy is bad.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sitting on a bubble. The banks have money. They give it to you for nothing if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re rich. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not rich, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s when you need the money, they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t loan it to you. So the people can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do jobs.\\nProbably here you have some great companies, some really good smaller companies, you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get the banks to give you money. The banks are controlled by the regulators. They system that this country is run under is out of control.\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to change it. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to bring back the jobs. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to bring back our companies.\\nAnd you know I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had such a response. And the reason I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had response is because of that and then I look at the ads today.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in hotel and I look at the ads and Cruz makes up these ads. \"We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to bring back jobs\" \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s using my same language.\\nHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the problem. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know where to begin. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know where to begin.\\nAnd if they did, Lyin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Ted, lyin\\xe2\\x80\\x99, he comes up. Did you ever see a guy like this? Just look what he did with Ben Carson.\\nBen Carson, who endorsed me by the way, is a great guy, and Lyin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Ted, remember in Iowa, he said \"Ben has left the race. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s left the race.\" This was on election day. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not like two days before or the day after. \"During the election, he left the race.\" Okay? And people believed him and thousands of votes were cast not for Ben but for Ted Cruz. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pure deception. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lying.\\nAnd then there were many other things. And actually during one of the debates, Marco Rubio looked over and he said, \"You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a liar.\" And I said, \"You know, I never heard a politician call another politician liar so we can do it.\" So we now call him Lyin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Ted \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Lyin\\xe2\\x80\\x99. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s crazy. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s crazy.\\nI mean, what he does and what he says is just terrible. And you know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve met a lot tougher people but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never met any human that lied as much as him.\\nAnd he comes in and you noticed the tremendous evangelical support I have? I have Jerry Falwell Jr. from Liberty University. I have all of these people. I have such incredible support.\\nAnd the evangelicals \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he thought he was going to get the evangelicals but they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like liars and they see he lies so much.\\nDo you ever see him \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he walks up and he walks in with the Bible, held high. Right? Held high and then he starts to lie.\\nBoy, he is bad.\\nSo anyways, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to fall for that. I really don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think that anybody is going to fall \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk. He debates...I said, \"Ted, take it easy. Just talk. Talk. Talk.\"\\nBut we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing really well. The whole thing is just working out. And I loved being here. You know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been here for a long time. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been here for a long time. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going here \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to stay tomorrow. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have some, I think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing Fox and Friends tomorrow morning. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing some shows tomorrow. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do some shows and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be around and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make sure \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we want to bring this home.\\nIf we can \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, we have a movement going on, folks. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a movement of intelligence, actually. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a movement of common sense. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all it is.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to let Carrier make air conditioners, fire all of its people, move to Mexico, make the air conditioners then come in and take the money out of the country. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen anymore.\\nAnd I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a free trader. And they say, \"He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \" Remember Jeb Bush? \"He is not a conservative.\" I said, \"What?\" I am a conservative. But you know what? I believe in free trade.\\nBut when you have free trade, you need smart people running your side of the free trade.\\nIf you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have smart people or if you have people like Ted Cruz that are totally controlled by the people that give him the money and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re controlled by the establishment. I mean, look at the establishment.\\nThis guy in his whole life didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what the word establishment meant. Now you have all these people going because they said, \"Oh man, Trump is terrible. He doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want any of our money.\"\\nI had one friend that came into my office \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever said this before. He came into my office. He wanted to give me millions of dollars. I said, \"I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take your money. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want your money. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m self-funding.\" He said, \"No, no, no, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to be kidding.\" He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know. He thought I was kidding. He wanted to endorse me, wanted to support me. I said no, no, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want. Anyway, he was finally convinced that I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want his money and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leaving. And I said, \"By the way, what are you going to do now?\" He said, \"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to give it to another candidate.\" And I said, \"Why?\"\\nThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re gamblers. They have to do it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like almost a disease. They have to do it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the craziest thing.\\nHe loves me. He wants to give give me probably close to $10 million. Right? I would have had the greatest Super PAC in the history if I would have taken all the money.\\nAnd my whole life, you know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve said this before, my whole life as a business person is this. Right? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s okay. Nothing wrong with it. I take. I keep taking. I take and take.\\nBut now I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to take for the United States. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to be the stupid people anymore. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to be the stupid people anymore. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be.\\nAnd with NATO when they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pay, you know, I said \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I was asked a question by Wolf Blitzer, a very fair question about NATO.\\nNow, you know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been a businessman. World class. I filed my business papers. They were phenomenal. Everybody says great, great, great. I built a great company. Very little debt. Tremendous cash flow. Some of the greatest assets in the world.\\nAnd I tell you that only for one reason \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the thinking we need in Washington. We need some of that thinking.\\nAnd Wolf Blitzer asked me a question on television. He said, \"Let me just ask you about NATO.\" Now, I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been asked about NATO a lot but I understand NATO and I understand common sense, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m like a smart person like many of the people in this room. Hopefully all of the people in this room.\\nBut he asked me about NATO. I said, \"It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s obsolete.\" This was my first thing.\\nAnd you know what? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the first one.\\nGuys that study NATO and good people but they study NATO and they say, \"I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it. What he just said, I never thought of it.\" They study it because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re so into it that they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t realize because it was really put there.\\nYou had the Soviet Union and now you have Russia, which is different but Russia is powerful so we could sort of say that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a balance. So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll leave it.\\nBut it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really cover terrorism like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supposed to. Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the right countries. I mean, many of the countries and there aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that you associate with terrorism.\\nAnd so I said number one, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s obsolete.\\nI said number two, to the best of my knowledge, the United States pay far too much proportionately and why are we always paying the bills to protect other people?\\nAnd the press, which is so totally dishonest, the press goes \\xe2\\x80\\x93 headlines the next day \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"Trump doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want NATO, wants to disband NATO\". And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not what I said.\\nI said, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to pay your bills. And you know what? If you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pay your bills, honestly, there should be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to go because we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it. You know, this isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t 68 years ago. This isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t when it was originally formed like many, many years ago, many decades ago, and you have to re-do things.\\nBut it is interesting. Some of the smartest people have said \"What Trump said is genius. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s obsolete. And you know what? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true.\" There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot of people, a lot of countries being given a free ride. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the free rides any more, folks.\\n...Thank you. Well, we need somebody with that...And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s America first, folks. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s America first.\\nSo then, as you know, North Korea is a big problem. North Korea is a problem. A problem that could be solved easily by China but they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to solve it because they want to tweak us. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re building in the South China Seas a massive military fort. You know what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on. They shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be doing that.\\nAnd they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re taking our money and, you know, you talk about the imbalance of trade, you talk about the kind of money. How about this? We owe China $1.7 trillion.\\nNow, they take our money. They take our jobs...I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not angry at China. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m angry at our people and our leaders for letting it happen.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not angry with China. If you can get away with it, you do it.\\nBut they take our jobs, they take our money, they take our money. They take everything.\\nWe owe them $1.7 trillion. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sort of like a magic act. Doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it? Amazing.\\nJapan, they send cars by the millions. They come off those boats. Los Angeles \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I was there at the docks. I looked at the biggest boats you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen. Biggest, greatest ships you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen. The cars are pouring off the ships. We owe them $1.5 trillion.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like, well, how does this all happen? Okay? How does it happen?\\nHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the story, folks.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to change our thinking. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be the smart people again. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be so smart. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be so sharp.\\nSo a lot of people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know we protect Japan. Do you know that? Does anybody know? You might know...We protect Japan. We protect Germany. We protect South Korea.\\nWhen you want a television set, who do you get it from? South Korea. Samsung. LG. You get it from South Korea.\\nSo we protect all and big ships they make. These are monster, monster economies. We protect them.\\nThey don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pay what they should be paying for not having to have this massive military apparatus that we supply.\\nAnd you know what? We get that because we have people that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing in Washington for many years. I mean, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not even blaming it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Obama\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the worst. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the worst. The worst.\\nI mean, when he just realizes, I mean he just realized that the Iran deal is a bad deal. It just took him \\xe2\\x80\\x93 realize \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I said, \"Oh, why didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you listen to me two years ago?\" Just two years ago if he would have listened \\xe2\\x80\\x93 can you imagine? Did you ever see a deal take so long?\\nBy the way, usually when a deal takes that long, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bad automatically. I can usually tell you that.\\nBut anyway, so we protect Japan. So it comes out...I said, look, I would have to tell Japan and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m talking about other nations also because I have great friends from Japan, I have great friends from South Korea. We have to go see them, go to talk to, have a meeting with them, \"We love protecting you.\" We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want them to arm necessarily. But you know, at some point, how long are we going to do this?\\nSo we have to see them and we have to say, \"You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to help us out.\"\\nYou know, we have this massive, massive amount of money that we have to get rid of because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sitting on one of the worst bubbles you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll ever see. Okay? Believe me. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to straighten it out.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to straighten out our trade deals. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to straighten out our military deals. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re taking care of all these countries.\\nSo we go to Japan. And here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what the...I was telling the people and they said \"Wow, that sounds good.\" We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to take \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to take care of us.\\nNow, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll probably say initially \"No\". And then we leave and then they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to say, \"Yes.\"\\nBut if they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say yes, you always have to be prepared to make a great deal to walk. You have to be...\\nThe problem with the Iran deal was that Secretary Kerry was like an amateur. Call him amateur night. He refused to walk. They were laughing at him in the streets of Iran. They were claiming the deal was the greatest deal ever made before it was even made. They were saying \"This deal is unbelievable.\" They were laughing at the Secretary of State of this country. They were laughing at the United States saying that this deal is great. And they were dancing. Remember? Burning the flag dancing?\\nWhen they start dancing about a deal that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m making, when they start burning the American flag, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m out of there. Bye bye. Good luck.\\nAnd he just kept going back.\\nAnd I kept waiting. I wanted to call him. I wanted to call him. I wanted to say, \"Walk.\" Because every single thing \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d say, \"We would like to get this.\" \"No!\" \"Oh, okay. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got it. We would like to get that.\" \"No!\"\\nYou know, the Persians are great negotiators. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an unbelievable deal.\\nBut just yesterday, Obama just yesterday he brought it up that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very unhappy.\\nI mean, think of it. Think of it. $150 billion. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the worst deal. We didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get our prisoners back. We should have had the prisoners back before we started negotiating. Increase the sanctions. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sit at the table. Say \"You give our prisoners back or we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not starting.\" You leave. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say \"No\". You leave. And what happens? You double up the sanctions. Within 24 hours, they call you and they say, \"You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got your prisoners.\" That could have been years ago. Right?\\nSo we have people that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing.\\nHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the story. You need Trump. You do. You need Trump. You bet...You do. I mean, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to have Trump.\\nI mean, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sort of interesting because I see when I turn on the television, I see these ads about myself by crooked people.\\nI see these ads and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re mostly wrong. A little bit sometimes are right but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all negative. You know. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m watching this on television \\xe2\\x80\\x93 ad after ad.\\nIn Florida, they spent $38 million on negative ads and I won it in a landslide...Does anybody read? Does anybody watch television? You know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not much for the advertising community when you think they spent $38 million \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a record number in Florida.\\nThey spent thousands and thousands of ads nationwide \\xe2\\x80\\x93 listen to this one \\xe2\\x80\\x93 55,000 negative ads on me. Most of them was made up.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll give you one good example.\\nWe have the Club for Growth, which is forget them. These are among the dumbest people that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll ever meet.\\nThey come to my office. They want me to give them $1 million.\\nA friend asked me, \"Please see them.\" I said, \"Who are they?\" \"They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re Club for Growth.\" Whatever that means.\\nSo they come to my office. They asked me for $1 million. I say, \"No, thank you.\" And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s it.\\nThen they write me a letter, which I posted, asking me for $1 million. I said very nicely \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not a bad person \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I said nicely \"No, thank you.\" I mean, you can be rich but you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to be stupid. Okay? Why am I going to give them $1 million?\\nSo, what happens is all of a sudden I see their name all over the place \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"Club for Growth\" and they talk about, you know, different things \\xe2\\x80\\x93 ridiculous things. I mean, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the worst ads.\\nAnd by the way, once was a fraudulent ad because they said, \"If Cruz and Kasich got together and you added the delegates\" \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and they showed the delegates. Right? And you add them up \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m over here with a lot. And they said \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and they add them up and they show a graph that goes much higher than mine and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s much lower than mine.\\nThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a fraud. And what we did is we told them to stop that ad and that was a week ago. And we tweeted about it. And everybody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talking about it. And I see it last night again.\\nThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re crooked. So here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what they do. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like a form of extortion, I guess. Right? When you think of it. They come to your office. They ask for $1 million. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give them $1 million. They go out. They do negative ads.\\nThese are the people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, if these people about Trump \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they call it like \"No Trump\". What do they call that thing? They call it \"Never Trump\". Oh, you need Trump so badly though.\\nI was saying if they would work, if they would have worked so hard, so diligently against President Barack Hussein Obama, they would have beaten him. They would have had great budgets. They would have had everything they wanted.\\nBut with him...I always say, \"Obama is the worst negotiator I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen.\" You look at the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 no, except with the Republicans. He gets everything he wants.\\nI mean, you look at the omnibus budget from three months he got everything he wanted \\xe2\\x80\\x93 fund Obamacare, bring people into the country that shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be here. He got everything he wanted.\\nSo he is the worst negotiator worldwide.\\nWe have Sergeant [Bowe] Bergdahl. Right? We get Bergdahl, a traitor. No, no, think of it. This is a negotiation. We get Bergdahl. And they get \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what do they get? Five of their most coveted killers that have been in jail for eight years in Gitmo, which we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not closing down by the way. Okay? We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to run it.\\nSo we get Bergdahl, a traitor, who five or six \\xe2\\x80\\x93 probably six \\xe2\\x80\\x93 people were killed going out to try and get him back. He left. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a traitor.\\nSo we get Bergdahl, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we get. And they get five people that are right now back on the battlefield or soon to be back on the battlefield trying to kill everybody in sight, including us. Okay?\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to stop it. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to stop it.\\nSo with Japan, I said they got to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 maybe we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to walk. And the next day the headlines \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"Trump doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to defend Japan\", \"Trump wants Japan to get their nukes\".\\nOkay, here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the story, folks. You have Japan. Japan is very concerned with North Korea.\\nYou know, number one, I like the way it is now but I want them to pay a lot more money. They probably will. But if they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not so bad if they are at heads. Maybe we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not supposed to get into that fight. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bad fight. Maybe we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not supposed to. Okay? Okay?\\nSame thing with South Korea. I mean, every time he raises his head and he starts talking, every single time he raises his head, our ships start floating over, our planes start going over. We do all sorts of exercise. What are we get out of this? We have 28,000 soldiers on the line.\\nSo, we have to be taken care of.\\nNow, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m talking as a person financially. Okay? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m also talking militarily. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m talking financially.\\nWe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a country that can do this anymore.\\nSaudi Arabia, until the oil went down and now they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re still making a fortune. But Saudi Arabia was making $1 billion a day. We protect Saudi Arabia. If we weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t there, Saudi Arabia wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be there. If Saudi Arabia didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have us for years protecting them, they would have been gone a long time ago as Saudi Arabia. Somebody else would have it, probably maybe Iraq because he would have come back.\\nAnd by the way, speaking of that, you know, I was against going into Iraq. Everyone says, \"Oh, Trump is going to be very tough.\" I was against going into Iraq from the very beginning, from the very beginning.\\nAnd I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to build our military bigger, stronger than ever before. But you know what? Hopefully, we never have to use it. Nobody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to tell us what to do though. We have to shape it up because our military is totally depleted.\\nBut if our politicians would have gone to the beach for the last number of years, many years, we would be much stronger in a sense. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be much stronger because the Middle East is a disaster. You see the great migration. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a catastrophe.\\nYou see what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on in Germany. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a total mess. What she has done.\\nCan you imagine? She was Person of the Year.\\nI was supposed to be Person of the Year on Time Magazine. She beat me out and she destroyed Germany. Can you believe this?\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not good. I wonder if Time Magazine had that one to do over again what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d say. I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be in much better shape. Well, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve treated me nice. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been on the cover a lot.\\nAnd the reason we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re on the cover a lot is because we have a movement the likes of which people have never seen.\\nSo here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the story. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the story.\\nYou know, one of the great writers called me up and he said, \"What you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done is incredible.\" I said, \"No, no, I have to win.\" He said, \"No, no, it makes no difference. If you win, if you lose, it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter. What you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done is down in the history books. You will be cover for all time. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s incredible.\" I said, \"No, sir. No, sir. I have to win. Because if I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win, to me, I will consider it a tremendous waste of time and waste of money but a tremendous waste of time.\"\\nSo here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the story. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the story. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take care of our Second Amendment. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being chipped and chipped.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get rid of Common Core. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to bring education back locally.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to repeal and replace Obamacare, which is a total catastrophe. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have great health insurance.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to save your Social Security. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to save your Medicare. We are going to save it because we are going to make our country rich again. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to bring back our jobs. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to let our jobs go. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be able to afford \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been paying in it a long time and a lot of these guys want it to be knocked to hell. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen. Okay? Remember that. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to start winning again, folks. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win anymore. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win anymore. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win with our military. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t beat ISIS. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to knock the hell out of ISIS.\\nWe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win with our vets. Our vets are being treated worse than illegal immigrants. Our vets are being treated so unfairly. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re our great people.\\nAnd other people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, vets have endorsed me virtually unanimously and a lot of the vets will come up to me and say, \"You know, Mr. Trump, we follow closely what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the only person that ever mentions the vets.\" Right?\\nAnd Hillary Clinton recently said about the vets that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re being taken care of just fine. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not being take care of fine. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not being taken care of. She said they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re being taken care of just fine.\\nI know the vets. Nobody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s spent more time with the vets that are running. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take care of our vets. Okay?\\nWe are going to tear up and make great and very lucrative and everybody is going to be happy, including the other side, trade deals.\\nI have the greatest people in the world for dealing.\\nWe use political hacks that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re dealing against the smartest people in China, the smartest people in Japan, the smartest people from all over the world, and our negotiators are political hacks and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not using them anymore.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re using the greatest business people in the world and we have them in this country and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re endorsing me, and I know the best ones from the not so great ones. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have great, great trade deals.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have a strong border. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have a real border. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have a wall. Mexico is paying for it. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have a wall.\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to stop bad, bad things from happening in this country. Because if you look at what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on and you look at the tremendous crime and you look at the drugs that are pouring across the border, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the drugs are pouring like water. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re pouring across.\\nYou know when I won \\xe2\\x80\\x93 New Hampshire is a special place to me because they were the first victory I had. And I won New Hampshire, and I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expected to win it; Jeb was expected to win it. And I won it in landslide.\\nAnd I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d go around and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d see the people of New Hampshire, and they tell me, \"Mr. Trump, our biggest problem is heroin.\" I said, \"Heroin?\" It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make sense. You know, you look at the beautiful trees or the woods or the roadways and the lakes. I said, \"Heroin?\" It just doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s incongruous. Right? It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work. But it was heroin. And I said, \"If I get in, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to stop that problem.\" Then I said, \"Where does it come from?\" They said, \"It comes from the southern border. They come right in.\"\\nNow, New Hampshire rated it their number one problem. They have a tremendous problem. But many other communities, including you, but many other communities have this problem. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to stop it cold, folks. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to stop it cold.\\nAnd the bottom line is this. Look, we have a big, big day. And you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to look back on this evening and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to say that was one of the great evenings of your life because we love the country. We love the country.\\n...I love you too. Thank you.\\nReally do. I love the people. I love the people.\\nYou know, they say Donald Trump \\xe2\\x80\\x93 my base is so strong. They say, \"Donald Trump can do almost anything.\" In fact, one person today said \"Anything\".\\nAnd they interviewed a woman, I saw her last night on television sitting in a hotel room, which was not the most beautiful room I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever been. It was very clean, and I only want clean. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care about the room. I want clean.\\nBut they were sitting there and they said to a woman \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a wonderful woman, probably 55 years old, and her friends were there. And they said, \"What would it take to get you to vote for somebody other than Donald Trump?\" She said, \"Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t play that game. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing he can do that would get me to vote against him.\" And I wanted to go up and I wanted to hug that television set.\\nI wanted to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I wish I could find out who she is. But we have so many people like that. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all like that. I mean, a big chunk of the country is like that because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re tired of stupidity. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re tired of seeing what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening to our great country.\\nSo, here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the deal. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to go home and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to remember this.\\nBut much more importantly, tomorrow, you get everybody you can and I promise you. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be so proud of your country. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to go out and vote. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be so proud of your president. But forget that. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be so proud of this country again.\\nAnd you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to remember the evening because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to start winning again. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win on trade. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win with our military. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to knock out the ISIS.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win. We are going to win with the military. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to knock out ISIS. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to knock them out.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win for our vets because our vets have been treated too badly. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen anymore.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win at the border. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win with education.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win with our Second Amendment. So many people talk to me about the Second Amendment.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win at every single element of what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing. And every single thing we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win, win, win.\\nAnd you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to say, \"That was the single greatest vote that I have ever cast\", and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to look back and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be proud of yourselves and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be proud of your country again.\\nSo thank you very much everybody. This is a great, great honor. Thank you!\\nGet out and vote! I love you all! Thank you! Thank you very much! Thank you!\\nThank you. I feel so badly. Outside we have 5,000 people and they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get in. I feel badly. I want to apologize. We have speakers outside. But I want to apologize. Who would have thought we have over 5,000 people cannot get in.\\n...It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an honor to be here. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an honor to be with you. And very important. You know, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing really well and millions of votes ahead of Cruz. Millions.\\nYou know, I get a kick. I call him Lyin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Ted. Lyin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Ted Cruz. He stands up \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I win as you know, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen it. I have been winning all of the evangelical vote. But he stands up Bible high, puts it down and then he lies. You know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amazing to watch it.\\nBut he said, \"Yeah, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the only one who can beat Donald Trump. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done it time after time.\"\\nAnd I said, \"Wait a minute. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve won like most of the states.\"\\nI think he had like 5 or 6 and I had 20 or 22. Right?\\nAnd I said I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it. And I have millions of votes more.\\nHe says, \"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the only one that can out-vote him.\" And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m saying but I have like millions of votes more.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you something so important. There is something happening. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like a movement. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s incredible. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a movement. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re part of the movement.\\nNot me. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a messenger to be honest. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a messenger.\\nAnd this is something that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so special and so amazing and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on the cover of time magazine. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on the cover of every newspaper. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something that has maybe never happened and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re saying it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s phenomenon.\\nSometimes they say I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a phenomenon. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not. The message is what we want.\\nWe want jobs. We want trade deals that are smart deals not stupid deals.\\nAnd you know, Wisconsin. I wrote down some notes...and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like devastating.\\nSo [Scott] Walker came out today. I wrote down notes about Wisconsin.\\nLook, he certainly can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t endorse me after what I did to him in the race. Right?\\nBut look at this. By the summer of 2015, Wisconsin was facing a $2.2 billion two-year budget deficit. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s terrible.\\nBy the way, these are out of books. Like this isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Trump. This is out of books.\\nTotal state debt is $45 billion. Now, maybe somebody is going to tell me that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrong but again these are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 $45 billion. Very high. One of the higher ones.\\n20,000 fewer people in the labor force in Wisconsin than seven years ago even though population has grown by 100,000. So your population is higher.\\nNow, I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have done this but he endorsed Cruz. What am I going to do? Am I going to say he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s doing a great job? He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not doing a great job.\\nYou know, he comes in with his big motorcycle jacket and big Harley. I love Harleys. Right? But the motorcycle guys like Trump. They really like Trump.\\nAnd he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t look like a motorcycle guy to me. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sorry. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sorry.\\nUnemployment rate \\xe2\\x80\\x93 well, they say \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be possible. Unemployment \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they have down 20%. That can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be possible. What? Is it 20%? Effective or regular? Effective unemployment rate 20%. Hey, this is out of the big book.\\n800,000 food stamp recipients.\\nMiddle class hit very, very hard due to loss of manufacturing jobs. These are the stats. Right? You know about this, right?\\nIt goes on and on.\\nWisconsin has lost 15,000 net jobs to Mexico since NAFTA.\\nNow, just so you understand, Kasich is running also. We forget about him. He voted for NAFTA.\\nBoth of them want TPP. TPP \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Trans-Pacific Partnership. Both of them want Trans-Pacific. That will make NAFTA look like a baby, and Wisconsin will be hit so hard.\\n...\\n...But the motorcycle guys love Trump.\\nI love the disabled veterans and the veterans. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take care of our veterans. You know that, right? We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take care of our veterans.\\nWhat is it about Trump that they like?\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m serious. We went to Hilton Head. We went to different places, and there were hundreds, hundreds of bikers out there. Beautiful bikes. Lots of Harleys, right? Lots of Harleys. Made in America. But beautiful, beautiful bikes...\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what it is but they like me. I feel good with them. I feel safe. I got out took a picture. Secret Service went crazy.\\nI said, \"These are great people. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry about it.\"\\nBut listen, I appreciate it, fellas, I appreciate it.\\n...We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to keep you free. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to keep you free.\\nBecause we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting rid of ISIS.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have good borders. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have borders again. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have borders again.\\nSo here we have something that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty interesting \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I love you too.\\nYou lost 70,000 jobs to China. 70,000 jobs.\\n100,000 illegal immigrants living in Wisconsin. Taxpayers are paying tens of millions of dollars.\\nLook, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know.\\nSo what happened with Walker and I just will finish off with this \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nice man. He came up to my office like about a year ago before I did \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been a politician for about eight months, right? I never thought I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be a politician. The last thing on my mind I want to be was a politician.\\nBut I built a great company. I filed papers. The company is incredible. Very little debt, tremendous cash flow, some of the great assets in the world.\\nAnd I say that not in a bragging way. I say that because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the kind of thinking we need, folks.\\nWe can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have China ripping us off and Mexico and Japan and Vietnam. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have it. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have it. And they are ripping us like they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never ripped anybody before.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve rebuilt China. I mean, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re rebuilding Mexico.\\nYou look the other day you saw Carrier moving down. Carrier Air Conditioning. I buy those air conditioners \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a lot of them. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not buying any more of them. But Carrier Air Conditioning moving to Mexico. Ford moving to Mexico.\\nNabsico \\xe2\\x80\\x93 home of the formerly wonderful Oreo which we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t eat anymore. Right? We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t eat it. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t eat it. Number one, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called an enforced diet.\\nBut you know what? Look, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re losing our jobs. Look at your jobs.\\nWhen I see that statistic, I mean you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re losing your jobs.\\nWhen I went after your governor when he decided to run and I said, \"You know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to be nice to him. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nice guy.\" The guy came up to my office. He handed me a plaque because I supported him. What do I know? I supported him. I gave $50,000 or $100,000. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot of money for a guy you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never met before. Right? That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty good.\\nBut I like the fact that he was fighting, fighting, he was always fighting.\\nYou know, to a certain extent, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rather see somebody able to make a deal without having to go through all of that mess.\\nBut he was fighting and I gave him a lot of money and he came up, you know, a year ago or so and he gave me a plaque. Beautiful picture of something. I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I never really got to read it to be honest. And I put it aside. That was it...\\nBecause if we win Wisconsin, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be like over, pretty much over. Because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do great.\\n...Emerson poll came out. I think I have 67%, 68% in New York compared to like 10% or whatever, and you have Cruz talk about New York values, New Yorkers are no good.\\nI watched New Yorkers rebuild the World Trade Center. I watched New Yorkers dying.\\nBelieve me, New Yorkers are good. New Yorkers are very good. But Cruz said they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re no good.\\nSo anyways, so I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do great in New York.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do great in New Jersey. Chris Christie endorsed me. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do great in New Jersey. Good guy.\\nBen Carson endorsed me. Sarah Palin endorsed me. Sheriff Joe from Arizona. We love Sheriff Joe.\\nAnd you know, with the evangelicals, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had so many ministers. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had so many pastors endorse me. And Jerry Falwell, Jr. endorsed me. It was incredible and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done so well with the evangelicals. I mean, Christians, evangelicals, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done so well.\\nIn fact, in South Carolina, when we went to South Carolina, that was going to be Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s territory. He was going take it, except we won it in a landslide.\\nYou know that. You saw it. He was there. This guy follows me around, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you.\\nBut you were there. Remember, he was going to win that in a landslide. And then I started speaking. I started talking to people, and I started saying the good and the bad and the ugly.\\nAnd we won in a landslide and we won the evangelicals. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve won just about I think almost every place I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve won with evangelicals.\\nAnd it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been an amazing time.\\nSo now I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m here to talk to the people of Wisconsin. I have friends in Wisconsin. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been here before. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an incredible place but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a place that has problems.\\nBut you have a governor that has you convinced that it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a problem.\\nI remember when he was on the campaign trail, I was so nice to him. I said, \"How can I hit him? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to hit him. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to hit him.\"\\nAnd I was so nice. I hit Jeb instead, right? Right?\\nAnd I hit Rand, Rand, old Rand.\\nAnd I hit a lot of people and they all went down.\\nWouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it be nice to have a president that could just with his mouth make things happen that are positive? You know.\\nBut it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not with the mouth. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really with the mouth, the heart, and the brain. Remember the brain.\\nI have a lot of friends. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re good with the mouth but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not good with the brain. It all doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work. Okay?\\nYou know, we had an interesting thing today. A poll came out \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a nationwide poll. A great poll. It was Trump 48%. It was an NBC poll. Trump 48%. Cruz was second in the 20s, mid-20s something. And Kasich was way down.\\nSo what happened is they showed the poll. It was an NBC poll. They call it an NBC monkey poll. And it was on the Today Show, and it was on Morning Joe. Morning Joe held it up and he said, \"Wow, those are great numbers.\"\\n48% is pretty good. You have three people. You know. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get enough credit for that.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been at 42%, 44%, 45%, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had like seven people. How do you get 45% when you have seven people? Nobody says that. They say, \"He hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cracked 50%.\" How do you crack 50% when you have all these people running?\\nSo I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m at 48%. Poll was good \\xe2\\x80\\x93 way, way ahead of anybody else nationwide. And they showed Hillary Clinton \\xe2\\x80\\x93 hers is very close.\\nShe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got a little problem. Could happen. Got a bigger problem with the emails than she has with Bernie to be honest with you. She should have. Her bigger problem should be with emails. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find out how honest our country is, right?\\nBut she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got a sort of close race. And they put her poll up and it was put up there. You know, big letters.\\nAnd then they said, \"And Donald Trump is winning.\" That was it. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t put numbers up. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing great. In fact, they said, \"Donald Trump is winning,\" and they put some \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a little slightly negative statistic in \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it was like wait a minute. They put her numbers up and they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t put my numbers up.\\nFolks, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so unfair. The press is so dishonest. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unbelievable. That was Chuck Todd. That was Chuck Todd this morning on the Today Show.\\nThey put Hillary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s numbers. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m winning by a lot and they said, \"Donald Trump is winning. You know, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go to a new subject, okay?\"\\nNow, I guarantee you one thing. If I was losing or doing poorly, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll still be up. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be up all morning because they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m self-funding my campaign. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m putting up my own money. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like it.\\nTed Cruz and Kasich are getting money from the banking industries, the energy industries. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting money from the pharmaceutical companies. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting money from everybody.\\nFolks, you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t straighten out this mess \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in a mess \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do what you have to do.\\nWhen millions of dollars are given to Cruz and Kasich and millions from different industries, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to be able to say, \"Well, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do and go against the banking industry to do what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right for the people\" if the banking industry gave you millions of dollars. Now, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true with Hillary also. Now, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gotten millions of dollars.\\nBut I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the only one self-funding my campaign. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in for a lot of money. I in a lot of money.\\nWhat is beautiful is when I was running against Jeb in New Hampshire. I was in for like $2 million. Jeb was in for like $48 million. I was in first and he was close to last.\\nI said, \"Who do you want as your president?\"\\nBy the way, did Jeb endorse anybody yet? Because I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t heard. Because I think Jeb probably endorsed \\xe2\\x80\\x93 huh? Did he endorse? It just shows you how important it is. Nobody even knows. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know.\\nHe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll probably \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll endorse \\xe2\\x80\\x93 just so you know. Look, when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in war, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to fight and you fight hard.\\nWhen I fight, I win. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win. You know that. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win.\\nBut you know, you do pretty serious damage, right? Because you want to win and you want to win fast and a lot of people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t love you after you finish.\\nBut I just love you. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care about that.\\nIn fact, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re asking Cruz, you know, at the debate which by the way they said I won every single debate. Now I heard the other night, \"I want to debate Trump\". I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve debated him 11 or 12 times. Every single online poll has me winning the debates. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an okay debater but he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bad talker. You know, everything\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so dramatic.\\nAnd he waits. Phony. And he waits. You know, you ever see he goes sentence after sentence and then he stops for like three, four seconds. And then he goes again. It looks like we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in the theater. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not in the theater. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in the real world.\\nSo what happens \\xe2\\x80\\x93 thank you.\\n...By the way, the Sheriff is here and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great guy and his people are fantastic. Thank you, Sheriff. Thank you.\\nI mean, the only thing I feel so guilty about all the people outside. Feel so guilty. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to come back. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to come back, come back to this area. You guys cannot come. Okay? All of the ladies can come but the guys can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\nBut all of the people outside, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take a bigger place because I feel slightly guilty.\\nBut look, we have a very serious mess on our hands. We have a very serious situation.\\nWe have a country that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not protected.\\nWe have a country that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sitting on a big fat bubble that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to explode. In a certain way, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d say let it do now, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it after I get in. Three days it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll explode and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fault. Okay?\\nAyeyeye, we are in a big fat ugly bubble. We have interest rates that are so low that if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re rich like me I can borrow money for any amount. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a hardworking guy with a great farm or you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a hardworking developer or businessman you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t borrow money.\\nYou can only borrow money really cheaply \\xe2\\x80\\x93 think of how bad it is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you can borrow money for nothing practically if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re rich. But if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re rich, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need the money so you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to borrow it.\\nBut if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a businessperson and you want to go to the bank for a loan, you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get it.\\nThe regulators are running the banks. Dodd-Frank is a disaster, by the way. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a disaster. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a disaster.\\nBut the biggest disasters are regulations. Our rules and regulations are horrible. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get rid of probably 85% of them. There are some we live with. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to go back.\\nSo many people in this area have told me regulations \\xe2\\x80\\x93 regulatory climate \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is the worst they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen.\\nI have a friend, who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a farmer, and if a puddle forms, they consider it a lake for the purposes of environmental. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like a puddle and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d consider it a lake.\\nSo we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing. So here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make our country so great again. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make our country so strong again.\\nOur military is going to be so amazing. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re never going to have to use it.\\nDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to go into Iraq. All these guys think that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a tough guy so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to be so quick with the trigger. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to be quick.\\nI was the slowest with the trigger. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want the trigger.\\nNow, when Obama left though, he shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have left the way he did. He gave a certain date, and the enemy said, \"It can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be possible. Nobody would be that stupid. Nobody.\"\\nSo I actually don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99d hurt that much because I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think the enemy would ever believe that anybody would be stupid enough to give a date \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leaving on this date.\" And then he left. They said, \"He was serious!\" They pulled back. They pulled back. Then you see what happened. They pulled back then they went in with fury.\\nBut how about the 50 soldiers. He sent a couple of months ago, a few months ago, he sent 50 of our finest and instead of just sending them quietly, quietly sending them. What does he do? He sends them in and he makes a big press conference or announcement that \"We are sending 50 soldiers in Iraq, Syria\" and these soldiers have a big target on their backs.\\nWhy can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we just keep our mouths shut? Why can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we be unpredictable? Unpredictable? Right? Why can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we be unpredictable?\\nWhy does he have to tell \\xe2\\x80\\x93 first of all, it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even sound good when you say \"50 soldiers\" because it sounds like so small. People would say, \"Is that good or bad?\" I mean, that sounds small.\\nBut then when you think about it, why do we have to say that?\\nThese are extraordinary people. These are our finest. And they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re, you know, very dangerous missions. Why would you tell people that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sending them in? You just keep quiet and let them accomplish something.\\nThey are right now \\xe2\\x80\\x93 who knows what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happened to them? But right now, they have a big target on their back.\\nPeople that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve let go of at Gitmo have now killed Americans. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen that. You saw that yesterday. That came out yesterday. We let people go out of Gitmo and they kill Americans. Okay. Is anybody surprised at that though? Would anybody be surprised?\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re keeping it open. Now they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re spending, you know, hundreds of millions to run it. I guarantee you could run it a lot cheaper. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have a lot of money left over.\\nSo we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get efficiency in government. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to end Obamacare. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to replace it with something so much better and so much less expensive.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get rid of Common Core. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to bring our education local.\\nWe are going to preserve our Second Amendment. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s under siege. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s totally under siege.\\nAnd Christianity is under siege. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you, Christianity is under siege.\\nYou take a look. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m with the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been with so many pastors lately and Jerry Falwell Jr. was an example \\xe2\\x80\\x93 was telling me that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 first of all, he told me something that \"You remind me so much of my father.\" I thought his father was a great guy. What his father did with Liberty College and Liberty University. And Jerry to top it off has taken it to a whole new place.\\nBut when Jerry was so strong and so great.\\nBut I was talking to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I probably had 50 of the ministers and pastors, different folks came up to my office, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re really under tremendous pressure because they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to have their tax exempt status taken away. This happened during the Lyndon Johnson presidency.\\nAnd I said, \"Why is it that you folks are pushed around so much?\" Christianity. These are the pastors. These are strong people. These are really strong people. \"Why do you allow that? Why aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you more forceful?\"\\nAnd finally, somebody said, \"Well, we have to be a little careful of our tax exempt status.\"\\nI said when did that happen exactly? It was during the Johnson.\\nWell, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to try to get rid of that. Okay? Because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really terrible.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to try getting rid of \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve said that to a lot of evangelicals, a lot of great Christians. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to try to get rid of it because it sort of means somebody walking down the street has more power than somebody of religion, of our religion, of Christianity, somebody that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an evangelical.\\nYou take anybody they have more power because these people are powerless.\\nThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve actually taken their right of free speech away.\\nSo I said we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to try to get rid of that and I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be very, very successful.\\nYou know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interesting. I said how many Christians are there? Because you know, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got men, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got women. You cut it in half, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve actually have a few more women. But we are far more Christians than we have men or women. So in a way, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the most powerful lobbyist \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the biggest group of people.\\nBut they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not allowed to talk because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re petrified.\\nYou saw what was happening with the IRS and what was taking place with regard to certain groups.\\nSo we are going to try and usually when I say try that means I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to get it done. That means I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to get it done.\\nBut we are going to try very hard. We are going to get that brought back and I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be very hard to counter it.\\nBecause if the Christians, and if the whole evangelical Christian sector gets together, nobody, nobody can beat \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nYou know, when I made the statement about banning Muslims on a temporary basis, I took such heat.\\nNow people are saying, \"You know, Trump is sort of right about that.\" Now they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all going, \"Wow\" because they see what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening.\\nAnd I think if I would have said it about Christians, I think I would have had less opposition. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happened in this country. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happened in our country.\\nAnd we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let it happen. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to turn this country around and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be the smart people. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to be the dummies anymore.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to be where China made last year trade deficits $505 billion. Japan over $100 billion. Mexico $58 billion.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to build a wall and Mexico is going to pay for the wall. Okay?\\n...Recently, I was in Florida and Marco, who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nice guy actually. You notice how nice they are after you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve defeated them?\\nI like everybody I defeat.\\nBut when I ran against Marco, it was supposed to be...well, he started it. Right? Just like Cruz started the last deal. He started it.\\nBut Marco came after me very viciously. You know he wanted to be Don Rickles, right? And it didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work.\\nBut what happened is I won by 20 points \\xe2\\x80\\x93 almost 20 points \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and a lot of these issue we were talking about it was big issues. And frankly, I wish I would have left about two days earlier. I wanted to stay in Florida campaign. I wish I would have devoted two more days to Ohio because I almost won in Ohio. I would have won in Ohio but I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to take a chance leaving my beautiful Florida because I love Florida and I wanted to win that.\\nSo if I would have left a couple of days early, I think I would have won Florida the same.\\nBut I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to have anything happen in Wisconsin. We have to win.\\nIf we \\xe2\\x80\\x93 look, we have to put these politicians in their place, folks. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time.\\nAnd believe me, you know, Cruz likes to pretend he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an outsider and in the meantime he gets all the establishment support, including your governor.\\nSo believe me, believe me, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all establishment.\\nAnd frankly in a way it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worse because Cruz is establishment and yet he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got no relationship with the establishment.\\nHe goes and he stands on the floor of the Senate for a day and a half and he filibusters, and these Senators \\xe2\\x80\\x93 look, I know. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re tough cookies. I have the best \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I have one of the great people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Sen. Jeff Sessions, who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great.\\nNobody better than Jeff.\\nAnd you know, Cruz thought he was going to have him and used him in his speech \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"Sen. Jeff Sessions\" \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and then he comes out and he endorses me.\\nBut when you think of it, look, out of all of these Senators, he has one supporter \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Lee \\xe2\\x80\\x93 who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s his friend. I mean, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s his friend. And by the way took him plenty time to do it.\\nBut you know, to stand there and to rant and rave for two days to show people you can filibuster, in the meantime, nothing was accomplished.\\nCruz has not accomplished one thing.\\nSo he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an insider but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s almost like the man on the street because he can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get anything done.\\nHe dislikes people. He calls people like for instance he said horrible things about the Speaker and you know about the Speaker and he said about separately Mitch McConnell.\\nI mean, he said some terrible things about \\xe2\\x80\\x93 how do you get things done when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re calling Mitch McConnell bad names. Okay? Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just say bad names.\\nSo he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sort of got the worst of all elements. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an insider totally but he can get nothing done. Okay? He can get nothing done.\\nYour new Speaker \\xe2\\x80\\x93 how do you like Paul Ryan? How do you like him?\\nWow. I was told be nice to Paul Ryan because \\xe2\\x80\\x93 really?\\nWell, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the Speaker. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nice guy. He called me the other day. He was very nice.\\nBut I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very surprised at this statement. Wow. Are you all Republicans? Are you mostly conservatives?\\n...I always say I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m just a common sense conservative. And so, so important \\xe2\\x80\\x93 common sense.\\nAnd somebody told me today that somebody else \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I think, Walker \\xe2\\x80\\x93 used my term.\\nYou know, Walker used \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I said, \"Make America great again.\" I said, \"Make America great again\", and I copyrighted the term.\\nAnd then Walker was making a speech many months ago when he first started and he was saying \"Make America great again\" because he saw the response that I got. The difference is he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get any response. So then no.\\nBut we told him he can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that. That was the first real problem I had with him...\\nNow, I said a common sense conservative and today I heard he used the term because the press was up and they interviewed me and they said he said he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a common sense conservative.\\nWell, I coined the phrase a few months ago. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I am. I am a conservative.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very, very conservative on the military. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very conservative with our vets and on health care and on lots of things.\\nBut \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m actually very conservative on trade but a lot of people would say \"He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not that conservative on trade because he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe in free trade.\" Well, actually I do believe in free trade. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to be good trade for us, right? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to be smart trade.\\nIt can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be where Wisconsin is losing thousands and thousands of jobs where you folks can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get into China but China comes in here like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Swiss cheese. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what happens.\\nYou know, China does not obey the rules.\\nNow, I get along great with China. I made a fortune dealing with China. I have two buildings because of China. Big ones in New York and one in San Francisco \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Bank of America \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that I have in partnership with a great company. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because of China. I sell \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I have one of the big leases with one of their big banks \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with the biggest bank in the world actually from China.\\nI sell millions of millions of condos to people from China. I like China.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not angry China. I like them. I think their leaders are doing a great job for them.\\nBut our leaders are doing a bad job for us.\\nSame with Mexico. I get along great. The Hispanics. I love the Hispanics. I love the Hispanics. But their leaders are killing us on the border and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re killing us on trade.\\nAnd I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not angry at them. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m angry at our country and our leadership because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grossly incompetent and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to change it around and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get the best and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get the finest.\\n...So whatever you can do to spread the world, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be around. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to Green Bay. I love their team, by the way. You talk about a great franchise. No, I love it.\\nAnd you have a truly great quarterback. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably endorsing somebody else but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still a great quarterback.\\nTom Brady\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a friend of mine. He said you have a great quarterback. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all right with me. When Tom says he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great quarterback that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty good.\\nBut you know, I really want to win Wisconsin because if we could win Wisconsin, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to put all of this stupidity away.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to put these stupid, stupid people that allow and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m talking about basically politicians, and in many cases, you know a lot of times people will see deals that are done and I mean take a look at the Iran deal. How bad is that I mean, just as a deal...\\nBut many times people will say deals that the country makes, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say, \"How can our politicians be so stupid?\" They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not stupid. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re being hit by the lobbyists and the special interests and they make a fortune. Okay? They get tremendous campaign contributions. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not stupid. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing it for themselves.\\nSo again, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not doing that. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing for you. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m working for you.\\nBut just remember, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not so stupid like you think.\\nBut when you look at the people funding Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign and Kasich\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign, and you look \\xe2\\x80\\x93 don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Cruz said, \"Oh the banks, the banks.\" You know, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be Robin Hood. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be this great guy.\\nAnd then in her personal financial disclosure form, he forgot to mention that he borrowed about a million dollars from the banks \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Citibank and Goldman Sachs. He borrowed a million dollars at an interest rate that everybody in this room would be proud to have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a very low interest rate. Almost no interest. He forgot to announce it on his personal financial disclosure form. He just forgot. He said, \"Oh, I forgot. I forgot.\"\\nOkay? So then he hits the banks. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s controlled by these people, folks. Okay? I mean, what he did was absolutely wrong. But they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re controlled by these people.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m controlled by you. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do the right thing for you. Okay? So remember that.\\n...\\nQ&A\\n22 veterans a day commit suicide. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s correct.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take care of our veterans so much. Look, let me tell you, they \\xe2\\x80\\x93 many of them kill themselves waiting for a doctor. They can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even get to see the doctor. You know that. They end up killing themselves before they see the doctor.\\n22 a day and a lot of people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even believe that number. They think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s almost like an impossible number \\xe2\\x80\\x93 how can it be so bad? \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and it actually could be even worse than that.\\nWe are going to take care of them. From their standpoint, they wait, they wait, then they get bad service, then they wait some more \\xe2\\x80\\x93 six, seven, eight days.\\nAnd sometimes they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see the doctor and the doctor says, \"I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see you now. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going on vacation.\"\\nYou see the corruptness.\\nI just left Phoenix \\xe2\\x80\\x93 21,000 people. Sheriff Joe was there. The job he did was incredible. Incredible.\\nYou know they had a little protest. Right? That protest ended so quickly. He arrested three people; everyone else scattered.\\nYou know, and you have that kind of a Sheriff here. You have a tough cookie here. I can tell you. I just met him and I can tell you.\\nBut you know I have a great policy plan and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gotten a lot of credit for it and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on DonaldJTrump.com. And with the veterans when they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re waiting for exorbitant time \\xe2\\x80\\x93 even for a little time \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to go to the doctor. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to go to local doctors or local hospitals.\\nMany of the hospitals are dying for business. You know that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re dying. Some of these hospitals are dying. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get immediate treatment, immediate service, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to pay the bills, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to save a fortune, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get great service.\\nAnd everybody is in love with it. Everybody loves it. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to happen. So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take care of our veterans.\\nIf we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take care of our veterans, we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take care of anyone. So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take care of our vets.\\nBoy, do you look good though. You look good and tough. I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to fight you.\\nDo you think I can take you in a fight? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think so.\\nHow about we do it right now? That would be great for television...\\nGo ahead.\\n...Let me tell you this. Our veterans are taken worse care of than illegal immigrants who come in our country...You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even have to write it down. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do things about it.\\nYou know what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re saying? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard this so many times before with the daycare and everything else. We are going to take care of our vets.\\nBy the ways, speaking of increase, Cruz and Kasich want to destroy your Social Security, folks, okay?\\nI want to bring money back into this country. I want to bring jobs into this country. I want to bring tremendous wealth into this country. I want to take our wealth back from China, from Mexico, from all of these countries that have our wealth. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve taken them like we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a bunch of babies.\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to save your Social Security and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to save your Medicare. They want to get rid of it. Okay? Remember that.\\n...\\nI want to use not too many executive orders folks. You know, because executive orders came about more recently. Nobody ever heard of an executive order.\\nThen all of a sudden Obama, because he couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get anybody to agree with him and he start signing them like they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re butter.\\nSo I want to do away with executive orders for the most part.\\nBut look, just do me a favor. Stick with me. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be okay. All right?\\n...I know, what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve said I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard a hundred times and daycare is a huge problem. Huge problem. And your wife not working? Huge problem \\xe2\\x80\\x93 she can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. So anyway, I bet you have a great wife. Good wife? Better believe it.\\n...We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re ending Common Core. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to be educated \\xe2\\x80\\x93 your kids in Wisconsin are no longer going to be educated in Washington, D.C. by bureaucrats \\xe2\\x80\\x93 many of whom \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say all \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but many of whom don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care for your kids. They couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care less. They get big, fat salaries. Your kids are going to be educated locally.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re terminating Common Core, and you will see something that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s magic. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen it where parents and all of these people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the uncles, the aunts \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all on the school boards. They get professionals. They have great principals.\\nYou can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on from Washington, D.C. Many of the people never even come here. They sit behind their desk in Washington. They draw big salaries. And they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re telling you how to educate their kids. Not going to happen that way.\\nAnd I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve even seen it where they keep graduates \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the child graduates and those parents stay on. They love it because their child went through the system. They love it and they become so good at it. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to happen.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re one of the worst in the world in education. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be one of the better ones. Not necessarily \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to beat Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and China. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to come very close.\\nDiscipline in schools. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think that Wisconsin should have a big problem with discipline. You have a big problem with discipline?\\n...Well, we have to get discipline back in the country, forget about school. We have to get discipline \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nI mean, I have a case. I have a wonderful guy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 campaign manager. You talk about discipline. And you probably saw what happened today with my campaign manager. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good guy. Corey [Lewandowski].\\nAnd by the way, the easiest thing \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"Corey, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re fired.\" I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it.\\nSo fortunately, I have a taping system. You know, very \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m rich so I have tapes all over.\\nSo this young woman who complained, was all \\xe2\\x80\\x93 she was talking about being maybe thrown to the floor and all this. I said, \"Oh, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s horrible.\" And then we saw the tapes.\\nDid anybody see the tape? What did you think? Right? Nothing.\\nWomen \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what did you think? [Audience response inaudible]...\\nI mean, she wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like \\xe2\\x80\\x93 her face stayed the same.\\nIf somebody squeezed your arm or did something really bad \\xe2\\x80\\x93 don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget \\xe2\\x80\\x93 initially she said thrown to the floor. But if somebody squeezed your arm or hurt you, wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you start screaming or something?\\nDid you see any change in her face? [Audience response inaudible]\\n...It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s horrible. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s horrible. Honestly, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s horrible.\\nAnd the best thing I could do is say \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t destroy a man. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d destroy him. Got a beautiful wife and children and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to destroy a man for that.\\nAnd you know what? When I saw that at the tape, at first I said, \"Oh, this is terrible.\" Then I saw the tape. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my tape. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the one that had the tape. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on the ceiling of this incredible club in Jupiter, Florida, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all leaving and we have a press conference. Right?\\nAnd the press conference lasted a long time. It was like 45 minutes. So that was enough.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m leaving with a whole big gang of people. People pushing left and right, left and right.\\nAnd all of a sudden, she bolts into the picture. She grabs me or hits me on the arm. In fact, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m like this with my arm up and then he goes by and maybe he touched her a little bit. But I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it was almost like he was trying to keep her off me. Right?\\n[Audience response inaudible]\\nLike he was helping her. And did you see her fall to the ground?\\n[Audience response inaudible]\\nOkay, because she talked about falling to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 now after, I must tell you, her statement changed big league because she said go to the ground. You know, all this. I could read it to you. Does anybody want to hear it?\\nI mean, I want to be accurate because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like the press to treat me.\\nSo before she knew she was on tape, she said \"I was jolted backwards.\"\\nWas she jolted backwards? I mean, if she was, her face stayed the same. I mean.\\n\"I was jolted backwards. Someone grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me me down. Campaign managers aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t supposed to forcefully throw reporters to the ground, except she never went to the ground. She never even came \\xe2\\x80\\x93 flinched.\\nShe didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, if somebody grabbed you even one of the guys, even the bikers, if somebody grabs even a biker or punches you a little bit, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re \"Whoa!\" Right? I mean, the toughest guy, the toughest woman. Look at her face. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s zero.\\nThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to destroy a man\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life?\\nAnd then I have Cruz saying, \"Oh, that was a terrible thing. That was a terrible thing.\"\\nLet me tell you something, folks. If I win, if I lose, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to do this. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing this because I just had a beautiful grandchild with Ivanka. Ivanka and Jared \\xe2\\x80\\x93 beautiful, beautiful grandchild. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my eighth. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing this all for them.\\nI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to do this. This is not so easy. And I had no idea. You know, maybe none of us did. You know, I had no idea the message was going to get across. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a message of competence. It really is. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a message of common sense and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a message of competence.\\nAnd I had no idea that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have millions of more votes than we had when we had that stiff Mitt Romney \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a total stiff \\xe2\\x80\\x93 who by the way he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a dope. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a smart person. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you right now.\\nLet me tell you about Mitt Romney. That was an election he should have won and he lost. And he should just go away and let the big boys do it now because you know what? That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an election that should have been won.\\nAnd I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what. I helped John McCain and at that time, honestly, that was a tough deal for him because the world was sort of collapsing. But he lost.\\nAnd I helped Mitt Romney a lot and he lost. And I said, \"This time, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do it ourselves. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win.\" So just remember that.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win because of Wisconsin, I hope...\\nRight! She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so smart. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want them to know. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to tell Putin what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m thinking. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so smart.\\nWhat you just said...what about Ukraine? Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry about Ukraine. Ukraine is going to be fine. Just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ask me why.\\nYou know, this world of politics \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"Mr. Trump, you said -\" don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the one that said take the oil. I was right. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take the oil. You know who has the oil right now? ISIS has the oil.\\nYou know, that Libya \\xe2\\x80\\x93 ISIS has all that oil from Gaddafi, all of that big oil from Gaddafi. He took it. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re like a bunch of dummies.\\nWhy aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we embargoing? Why aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we creating a nice big circle so they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get the oil out? Why aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we taking that oil back?\\nLook, look, look, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the one that says though I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to say everything.\\nIf I win, I have a good chance of winning. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the frontrunner by a lot. I want to go in there. I want to knock the hell out of ISIS. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to tell all. I really mean this.\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to tell everybody in this room \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and look at all the cameras that are going now \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to tell the world what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re watching.\\nJust let me do it folks. I will do it. You would be so happy. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to know the details. Okay? Let me do it.\\nYou know, I used the word before. We have to be a little bit unpredictable. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say, \"Well, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going and attack on March 14th and then we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to hit them from the front and then we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to hit them from the back.\"\\nYou know, Obama did that eight months ago with one of the cities. He said, \"We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going in next week.\"\\nLook, folks, folks, folks, you know, you have to trust \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there has to be some trust. Right? Do you trust?\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to stop the stupid. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why I really think your question is so great \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to hear how you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do it, Mr. Trump. Just do it.\" I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do it. Okay?\\nI love that. That woman! That woman! Thank you, honey. Thank you.\\nOkay. I can see why.\\nWoman:\\nThank you. You have been \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I just want to say thank you. You saved me in so many ways.\\nIn recent years, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been struggling with an incurable illness and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m on home care now. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s caused by a doctor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s medical negligence.\\nAnd in those dark days fighting \\xe2\\x80\\x93 right now all the tubes have been removed and I have a Do Not Resuscitate Order and I have a seven-year-old son \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in those days in the hospital, I received from you a handwritten letter that said, \"To the bravest woman I know.\"\\nI remember that. I remember that. Such a wonderful, beautiful woman. I mean, just an amazing woman.\\nAnd are you coming along okay?\\nWoman:\\nNo, sir. But that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s okay because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m here right now to thank you in person and that was my biggest dream.\\nAnd I wanted to thank you because through you and your organizations, my son who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Mexican-American, seven-years-old, through your organization and just being able to stand on that stage with you back in 2005 the outpouring of love that can from that ultimately provided my son when he graduates high school with a full ride to college.\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great. And you know what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do? We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to watch him. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to watch him. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be watching your boy. Okay? But you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be hopefully around. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to have to have anybody watching. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to hopefully be around. Those doctors are going to be so wrong. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be helping you.\\nWoman:\\nSo we thank you. God bless you. And just, you know, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a Mexican-American, and you because of your efforts have sent him to college. And I have been writing letters to him for when I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in heaven to tell him that what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done for him now he has a great responsibility to pay it forward just as you have done for us.\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so nice. Thank you.\\nI have to go down and say hello. Is that okay?\\n...Very sad but I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be really a story of hope and something that is really great is going to happen out of that. You watch.\\nBut it sort of tells me when I first said this people would say, \"Oh, it will cost a lot.\" Forgetting about the campaign. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s peanuts by comparison. You know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve spent tens of millions of dollars.\\nBut the big thing \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I lost certain businesses and I owned the Miss Universe Pageant. I bought it very inexpensively many years ago \\xe2\\x80\\x93 15 years ago \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and because of the fact that they thought I was against this woman or that one, I had a hard time with television.\\nNow, the good news is I sold it for a wonderful \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I was very happy with that. But I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to sell it. But I sold it and I built it to really a great company. We did a great job with that company \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Miss Universe, Miss USA, Miss Teen USA.\\nBut other businesses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I sort of \\xe2\\x80\\x93 like the shirts and the ties with Macy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. Macy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s was unbelievably disloyal because of illegal immigration and they ended the shirts, ties. Who care? I mean, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a big deal.\\nBut I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing something \\xe2\\x80\\x93 nobody is giving up what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m giving.\\nI mean, when Cruz runs, he runs. If he wins, great. If he loses, great. You know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s him. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a politician. They just \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they run, they win, they lose, who knows?\\nBut these guys run for office. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all they do.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always heard that if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a very successful person, you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t run for office, especially for president. You just can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t run for president, and I can see it. I have so much false press about me. Things that are so false.\\nYou know, I saw the other day on television, there were like 56,000 negative ads on me. 56,000.\\nIn fact, in Florida, I own Doral and in Florida we had the tournament there two weeks. Adam Scott \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the great Adam Scott \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the great golfer. He was winning. And in between shots, I told you this after the victory speech, in between they have commercials and they were all about Trump. Negative, horrible, negative commercials. Mostly false. Mostly. Not all false. But mostly false, I have to be honest.\\nBut it came out the other day, I think it said \"$68 million, 55,000 negative ads.\" Negative ads.\\nAnd when I was running in Florida, I said \"How is it possible to win?\" I mean, with all of this because I knew it. You couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t turn on in Florida where I was you couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t turn on the television without seeing Trump commercials. Sometimes four or five in a row. And they were horrendous. Done by very, very bad people. Very bad, evil people.\\nAnd I said, \"How it is possible to win?\"\\nAnd God helped me. Honestly. Because I won in a landslide. I won by almost 20%.\\nAnd now they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing it here. Club for Growth. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a crooked outfit.\\nLook, Club for Growth \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you ever hear this? Club for Growth \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a friend of mine, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a conservative guy. He goes would you do me a favor? See Club for Growth. I said, \"What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Club for Growth?\" He said, \"They want to talk to you.\" I said, \"All right. Send them up.\" He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a friend. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good guy. And now I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in politics so I have to see people I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t normally...\\nSo Club for Growth, they come up to my office. This guy was I think a former Congressman. And he tells me a little bit about Club for Growth and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m falling asleep. And then he goes, \"$1 million.\" And I said, \"$1 million for what? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know you. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never met you.\" I said, \"Do me a favor.\" I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m trying to be nice and I said, \"Go back and write me a little note if you can.\" And he was stupid enough to write me a note.\\nHe writes me a letter asking for $1 million. I let him know that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not interested. You could be rich. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rather take a million and throw it all over this room. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rather give it to you, to your boy.\\n...They write me a letter. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like extortion. They asked me for a $1 million. I said no nicely. And then they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing ads all over Wisconsin. Club for Growth. They did it all over Florida. Club for Growth. About eminent domain.\\nBy the way, without eminent domain, you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have highways, you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have hospitals, you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have bridges. You need eminent domain. If something\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in your way and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re building a highway, if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re producing 7,000 jobs and you need a little corner of someone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s property, every once in a while.\\nYou know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s funny. These guys all want the Keystone Pipeline. Right? Everyone. Conservatives. Conservatives want the Keystone Pipeline. I like the Keystone Pipeline too. But they have a whole big thing on eminent domain in their prospectus because without eminent domain, they wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go 15 feet. They wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be able to build it.\\nSo, they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want eminent domain. They do commercials about eminent domain. They love the Keystone Pipeline, and the whole Keystone Pipeline is based around eminent domain because you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to go from Canada, where Cruz was born, to Texas, where he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s representing. Think of it.\\nThis guy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget that. Remember what I said. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to win. Just remember what I said. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to win. And I thank you...\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to win. But remember this. If for some reason he does, he gets the nomination, the first thing \\xe2\\x80\\x93 remember, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a good prognosticator, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a good predictor \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the first thing that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to happen is the Democrats are going to sue Ted Cruz. He was born in Canada. He lived there for four years. The head of the Harvard Law School, one of the top people in the business in terms of Constitution, is saying that, you know, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrong. And we have a bunch of other people that are much stronger than even that.\\nRemember this. If Cruz gets lucky and wins, and the only way he can get lucky is if he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get \\xe2\\x80\\x93 because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all establishment. You know, if I go into that whole mess of the convention, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not the establishment. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take their money. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hire their people. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do any of that stuff. Okay? So you have a disadvantage.\\nBut if Cruz wins, remember what I said. Just remember. Again, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to win. But if he does, he gets the nomination, within the first few days he will be sued by the Democrats that he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the right to be president. And I think they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re right because he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t born on our soil. He wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t born. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a natural born citizen. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a natural born citizen.\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like to make a big deal of this but it was just brought up by somebody. He is not a natural born citizen. So if for some reason he should get the nomination, I really believe you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re wasting your time and boy do we have a problem because you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have somebody that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be sued, probably will lose the lawsuit.\\nAgain, he was born there, lived there for four years, mother was there, the whole thing for a long period of time, and he was a Canadian citizen joint with U.S. until 14 or 15 months ago. Did anyone know that? So he was a senator from Texas, only because of the great Sarah Palin by the way, without Sarah Palin, he could have never won that election. It was a fluke. But he was a Senator from Texas. He lived \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he was a joint citizen. Now, he finally gave up his citizenship to Canada like 16 months ago. He said, \"Oh, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know I was a citizen of Canada also.\" Just like he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that Goldman Sachs and Citibank gave him money. I mean, this guy is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you just have to study him, folks.\\nLook, again, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing this. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to turn this country around. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make America great again. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win a lot. But you have to know the facts.\\nI love you all. I love you all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Get out there and vote! Thank you!\\nThank you. Thank you! Thank you very much everybody. This was an amazing evening. This was a great evening.\\nThey just announced North Carolina.\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve even announced Illinois yet but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leading by a lot so I think they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to announce it.\\nFlorida was so amazing.\\nAnd I want to thank our friends. Northern Marianas Islands have been so incredible, and we picked up nine delegates this morning. I heard very early in the morning \\xe2\\x80\\x93 nine delegates. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot.\\nAnd I just wanted to thank the governor, Ralph Torres, great guy, Chairman [James] Ada who was a fantastic man and that was a very nice start to the day. That I can tell you.\\nMany things have been happening over the last short period of time.\\nCNN was very nice. They came up with a poll. The poll said 49% to 14% and 15%.\\nWe just had one from the Economist just came out \\xe2\\x80\\x93 53%.\\nAnd it was sort of interesting because I was watching the news a little while ago and one of the commentators, who I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not particularly fond of but these are minor details, said \"But Donald Trump doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get over 50%\" because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m at 43%, 45%.\\nActually now according to the Economist, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m at 53%.\\nAnd I have to explain to these people they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand basic physics, basic mathematics, basic whatever you want to call it. When I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get over 50%, we have four people. Right? We have four people. Do you understand that?\\nSo when I get 53% \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and this one is an example, I had 53% and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s with four people. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an achievement just mathematically when you can get over 50%.\\nSo someday, someday they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to understand, someday when we take it all, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll understand. But it is really ridiculous.\\nI want to thank my family. My boy, Eric and Don. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been working so hard.\\nIvanka and Jared have been amazing. Ivanka\\xe2\\x80\\x99s home right now. In about two minutes, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll call her. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about to have a baby so I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been thinking about that now for a little while but Ivanka has been so helpful and Jared has been amazing and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been just great.\\nI want to thank Barron for putting up with the fact that I never see him anymore. And I want to thank Barron. I never see my Barron and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s his birthday on Sunday so we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re very happy about that.\\nSo it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a little tough. You know, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going away and he goes, \"When are you going to be come home, daddy? When are you coming home?\" I said, \"Well, in about two and a half weeks.\" It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been pretty tough.\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re traveling all over the place. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really amazing. Yesterday I went up to Ohio. I went up to Youngstown.\\nWe had an incredible crowd and just amazing people in this country. We have so, so many great people.\\nWe will someday in the not so distant future if I win \\xe2\\x80\\x93 otherwise it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen I have to be honest with you. But Apple and all of these great companies will be making their product in the United States, not in China, Vietnam and all of \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to be losing our companies. You know, our companies are leaving our country rapidly, rapidly, whether it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Carrier air conditioning, whether it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Ford, whether it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Eaton.\\nI was in Cleveland and Eaton Corp. they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leaving and so many companies are leaving. And frankly, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m disgusted with it and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m tired of seeing it and there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no reason for it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just gross incompetence at the highest level. We should not allow it to happen. Pfizer, great company, pharmaceutical company, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to Ireland.\\nAnd there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so many more. You have corporate inversions. You have people who can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get their money back into the country because the politicians can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get along. They can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make a deal.\\nEverybody agrees \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Democrat and Republican \\xe2\\x80\\x93 everybody agrees the money should come back...trillion dollars outside of this country. Everybody agrees that the money should be here and the politicians for three years haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been able to make a deal.\\nAnd we could make a deal. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an example of something that you could do if I sat down with a few of the senators, a few of the congressmen, you could make a deal on that in 10 minutes if you know what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing because everybody wants to do it.\\nAnd companies are actually leaving our country to get their money, not only because our taxes are too high, which we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to lower by the way. But companies are leaving our country in order to go and get money that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s their money because there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no way of bringing it in.\\nSo, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got a long way to go. But I think at some point it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to get done. This has been very exciting, this whole process.\\nWe started, I was one of 17 people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 senators, governors. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had such great support. Dr. Ben Carson the other day endorsed us. Great guy. Great guy. Wonderful man. And Chris Christie endorsed us. That was so incredible.\\nAnd today Pam Bondi came up and endorsed us. She was great. She is a truly wonderful woman, of the job she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s done in Florida is incredible.\\nYou know, so many \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had such incredible support. Paul Ryan called me the other day \\xe2\\x80\\x93 tremendous call. I spoke with Mitch McConnell today. We had a great conversation.\\nThe fact is we have to bring our party together. We have to bring it together.\\nWe have something happening that actually makes the Republican Party probably the biggest political story anywhere in the world. Everybody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s writing about it all over Europe, all over the world they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about it.\\nMillions of people are coming in to vote. This was an example of it today. Many, many more people. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking at the polling booths. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking at the different polling booths all around the country where it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s up. And the lines are four, five, six blocks long. And the woman \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one woman was there for 40 years. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been working the polls. And she said, \"We\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have two people here. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have three people. Now look at the line.\" And the line looked like it was, you know, long. It was really long. Five deep and long. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just a different thing.\\nWe have a great opportunity and the people that are voting are Democrats are coming in, Independents are coming in, and very, very importantly, people that never voted before. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an incredible thing.\\nI want to pay my respects by the way to Todd Palin, Sarah\\xe2\\x80\\x99s husband. Sarah was here. She was incredible. She was making a speech on my behalf and fantastic and everybody loves her. And what happened is he was in a very bad accident. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tough as nails. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be fine. But I just wanted to pay my respects by the way to Todd.\\nSo, our theme when we started and Melania and I came down. Yeah, sit down everybody. Please. I mean, this is Mar-a-Lago. We give you seats. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to stand. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking at all these people.\\nCory, good job, Cory. Good job. And Hope and our whole squad. Right?\\nSo when this began, Melania and I and I said, \"Got to do it.\" And she was so supportive and she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been so supportive. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been amazing. And we have to do it.\\nWe came down the escalator and it was about trade and it was about borders. And what happened is pretty quickly after that and we were \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we shot right up. I shot right to the top of the polls and have been leading in the polls almost from the beginning without fail.\\nWe went up in June. Most people said I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never run. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just going to have fun. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s having a good time. This isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t necessarily \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I mean, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m having a good time. You know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m having a very nice time. But you know what? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m working very hard and there is great anger. Believe me. There is great anger.\\nOne of the broadcasters was saying, \"Is there anger?\" And I said...I was supposed to say, \"No, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not. We love the way things are working. We love the deal you made with Iran. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wonderful. You give them $150 billion. We get nothing. We love all the deals. The trade deals are wonderful. You lose $500 billion a year with China. We lose $58 billion a year in terms of imbalance. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a total imbalance.\"\\nWe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make good deals anymore. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win anymore. As a country, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win anymore.\\nAnd they asked, \"Is there anger from your people?\" ...They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not angry people but they want to see the country properly run. They want to see borders. They want to see good health care. They want to see things properly taken care of. They want our military rebuilt. Our military is in a very bad state. They want it rebuilt. Very, very importantly, and they want the Second Amendment by the way protected and protected strongly and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to happen.\\nAnd you know what they want so badly? They want our veterans taken care of. Our veterans are treated so badly.\\nSo, we started and something happened called Paris. Paris happened and Paris was a disaster. That was \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there have been many disasters. But it was Paris.\\nAnd then we had a case in Los Angeles where it was in California where the 14 young people were killed. And it just goes on and on and on.\\nAnd what happened with me is this whole run took on a whole new meaning, not just borders, not just good trade deals. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make the best trade deals you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got such endorsements from Carl Icahn and the smartest people in business. And these people are going to be negotiating our deals and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the best in the world. We have the best business people in the world. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have such great deals. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do so good with trade. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do so good on the border.\\nBut it took on a whole new meaning, and the meaning was very simple. We need protection in our country and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to happen and all of a sudden the poll numbers shot up. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m just very proud to be a part of this.\\nI think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to go. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to go on a lot of trips over the next month but I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have a great victory.\\nAnd I think more importantly than anything else we are going to start winning again. This country is going to start winning again. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win anymore.\\nWe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win with our military. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t beat ISIS. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to knock the hell out of them.\\nWe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win at trade \\xe2\\x80\\x93 China, everybody, Japan, Mexico, Vietnam, India, name the country. Anybody we deal, anybody we do business with beats us. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win at trade. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win at trade. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make our country rich again. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make our country great again. And we need the rich in order to make the great, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sorry to tell you.\\nSo, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going forward. We had a fantastic evening. I would have never thought this could have happened. I guess we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re waiting for one result which possibly will be very successful also.\\nBut to win the states that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve won and to win by the margins and especially, look, this is my second home, Florida. To win by that kind of a number is incredible. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s record-setting.\\nAnd I have to say that number one, I want to congratulate Marco Rubio on having run a really tough campaign. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tough. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s smart. And he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got a great future. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got a great future.\\nBut I have to say and nobody has ever, ever in the history of politics received the kind of negative advertising that I have. Record, record, record. By the way, mostly false. I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say 100% but about 90%. Mostly false, vicious, horrible.\\nThey said it was $18 million the first week, meaning last week, and $25 million. It added up to over $40 million.\\nAnd you explain it to me because I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \\xe2\\x80\\x93 my numbers went up. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand it. Nobody understands it. My numbers went up.\\nI mean, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been an interesting experience. Last week, Adam Scott won at the Trump National Doral. Won the big tournament, the world championship of golf. And Adam, who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great guy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I guess a lot of you folks saw that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m watching...we have television screens all over. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re down at this gorgeous green at Doral and everything is working beautifully and then a commercial comes on. The worst commercial and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m with these wonderful people from Cadillac and all these top executives, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m saying, \"Look over there! Look! Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t watch it. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to watch it.\" I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m saying, \"Isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the grass beautiful? Look! Look! Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t watch.\"\\nAnd they came in waves one after another after another and it was brutal.\\nAnd then Adam comes in. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s this handsome kid from Australia, one of the greatest golfers in the world, made an unbelievable shot on the 18th hole to win the tournament. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great champion. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re giving the award.\\nAnd just before we break for a commercial, \"We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be right back with our great champion from Australia, Adam Scott\" and here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the commercial and I said, \"No!\" And it was two of them \\xe2\\x80\\x93 two of them. Oh, what a day that was. What a disaster. What a disaster. Unbelievable.\\nSo again, I just want to congratulate everybody. This is a really interesting process. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an amazing process. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very tough. But it is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 by the end, if you get to the end, you can handle a lot of things including pressure because there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing like it. Lies, deceit, viciousness, disgusting reporters, horrible people. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. Some are nice. Some are nice. Some really disgusting people back there.\\nAnd I just want to say we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to go forward and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win. But more importantly, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win for the country. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win, win, win, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not stopping. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have great victories for our country.\\nThank you very much everybody! Thank you!\\n...So it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so important. You getting out to vote. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just so important because our country has been taken away from us. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going so fast.\\nAnd you know, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about Second Amendment because I was asking with Randy and a lot of people, I was talking to some of the people before, \"What would you like me to focus on?\" and they said, \"Just Second Amendment. Second Amendment.\"\\nNow, the Second Amendment means a lot of other things too...The Second Amendment in under siege. You know that. You know that very well.\\nWe lost a great Supreme Court justice and nobody thought this was going to be part of the equation. And all of a sudden if somebody gets in that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the wrong person, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take away that Second Amendment so fast your head will spin.\\nYou see Bloomberg is somebody that wants to knock out the Second Amendment. Hillary is a disaster on the Second Amendment. No, they want to take it away.\\nSo, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just not going to happen. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen.\\n...But we lost our wonderful justice who was a great man and a great Second Amendment person.\\nI just heard coming up, you know, the Senators. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been very disappointed. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a Republican. Many of you are Republicans. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not being protected whether it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a budget. You saw the budget that was approved a month ago. It was approved by the Republicans. They gave it away. They gave Obama everything.\\nSo Obama wants to put in a Supreme Court judge. He said he wants \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be a very negative person to guns because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way it is, okay? Believe me, that will be the way it is. And basically they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the right to do that.\\nBut I keep saying, \"Well, are the Republicans going to fail or are they going to crack? What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to happen?\" And coming up today, I hear, \"Well, there could be a way of Obama pushing it through.\" Here we go, right? Here we go.\\nSame thing you heard with Obamacare. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be defeated. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be repealed. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to repeal and replace Obamacare. Believe me.\\nBut \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I mean, look what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on with your premiums. 35%, 45%, 55% up. Your deductible is so high. I mean, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to see that truck right there? You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to get hit by that truck in order to ever use it.\\nSo, I come up and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m hearing that Obama now who said by the way yesterday, \"Donald Trump will not be the president. He will not be.\" No, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a compliment. Look, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States. So it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a compliment.\\nBut he was all over the place yesterday. Said, \"Donald Trump will not be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \" I think we have maybe a little surprise in store, and we start right here in South Carolina.\\nYou know, New Hampshire was so amazing. We had a big, big victory in New Hampshire. Amazing people.\\nAnd then we come down here and I said, \"You know, I think we have an ever bigger lead over here.\"\\nAnd the people have been incredible no matter where we go to speak. Even this. I know that four years ago, you had about 200 people here for the same kind of thing for your frontrunner and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good frontrunner, a good guy, and he did well but you had 400 people, 200 people. You have thousands of people here and we just appreciate it, and I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget it. Believe me, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to forget it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to forget it.\\nSo I hear that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about trying to get a liberal judge and a judge that does not like the Second Amendment and a judge that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and this is one of many. This is one of many but a judge that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to do a number on the guns and that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how important it is.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re just not going to let it happen. Okay? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going happen. And if we elected, we know that. But we have 9 months, 10 months to go. We have to have the Republicans hold fast because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m just hearing these little cracks, saying \"Well, maybe if he appoints somebody, maybe we could get along, maybe.\" It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the way it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supposed to be.\\nNow, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have their wish because if they win, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be having their choice. But if they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to start really taking back because we have 3 or 4 or 5 maybe Supreme Court judges. This was not supposed to be one in question. This was a very sad circumstance that happened with \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I mean, really to me it was a very sad circumstance. But now we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to see what happens.\\nI will only tell you this. We are doing well. We have a really good chance to win. If we can win in South Carolina, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to go \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I mean, we could very well run the table.\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if you saw \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I guess a lot of you have seen actually next week in Nevada. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be phenomenal. The relationship there to the people...Bush is 1% in Nevada. This guy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 why doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he just give up, just go home? Go home. Go home to mom. Got to go home to mommy. You know, Bush is only at 1% in Nevada. A couple of them are, you know, at 10%, 11%, or 12%. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m at like 40% something \\xe2\\x80\\x93 48%. So I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do well.\\nThen I think we have the SEC. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have the SEC, which is going to be I think amazing.\\nBut really now we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re starting. New Hampshire could not have been better. They gave us a tremendous send-off. They really started us on our way.\\nAnd we did well in Iowa. I mean, some votes were stolen from Ben Carson, which by the way was a disgrace. What Cruz \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what this guy Cruz did with Ben Carson was an absolute disgrace. What he did was \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he stole. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s theft. And then they come out with a voter violation form, which is a fraud as far as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m concerned. And what he did with that whole thing was a disgrace. So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to let that stuff happen anymore. I mean, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to let it. We will not let it happen. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all watching. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all watching. Keep your eyes wide open.\\nThese politicians \\xe2\\x80\\x93 here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a guy, he raises the Bible and yet he tells fibs, he tells lies, and then he does this stuff to Carson and he does other things. Very bad.\\nSo politicians are bad people. Boy, they are bad. Would you believe it?\\nSo we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to let it happen and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get in there...So Saturday. Go out and vote. This is going to be the place that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really going to make it.\\nAnd honestly, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been watching all the pundits. Now, the bad news is they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re always wrong. They all said I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not running and I ran. Well, how is he going to do? He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just doing this for fun. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not doing this for fun. Believe me, I love this location but I know I can be someplace else. Okay? I could be someplace else right now. I could be very happy.\\nBut I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing it because you know the expression and I see all the hats in the audience \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Make America great again. We are going to make America so ... ...\\nWe are going to win again. You know, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win very much. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re very smart, tough people. You like to win. Right? This guy over here. You like to win. And we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win anymore. We used to win. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win anymore. Well, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to start winning again. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to start winning again.\\nSo, Second Amendment protected. Common Core. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to end Common Core. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re bringing your education locally. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be fabulous. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if you know or if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard me say we have the absolute worst \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we spend number one in the world on education. Right? Number one per pupil in the world. There is no second place because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re so high, so much \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you have China, you have Norway, you have Denmark, you have Sweden. You have these countries are the best in terms of education and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re on the list the best. And the 30th in the top 30 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re number 30th. Okay? We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re number one in costs.\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a little bit like what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the least spent money. You know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m funding my own campaign. Right? So, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a lot of the people coming to me. You know, the drug companies and all of the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 because if you would see the kind of waste, fraud, and corruption in the United States, a lot of it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really waste, fraud, and corruption. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the fact that people that are running against me and people in the Senate, people in Congress, they have tremendous power because they have people giving them unbelievable campaign contributions and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re special interests and they do what those people want. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the reasons why our budget is out of whack, the military is out of whack. The military orders equipment they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even want and the stuff they do want they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get because the company that makes that equipment is like, you know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not politically adept, and companies that really are, they make the equipments we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to all change because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not getting any money from all of these people. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give a damn. I mean, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do the right thing. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to absolutely do the right thing.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you a little story. So the drug companies. We are the largest purchasers of drugs in the world, the United States...which makes a lot of sense I guess. But we purchase more drugs that make you better, drugs that make you better, not the kind of drugs that come over the southern border, which we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to end. Okay? We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to build a wall. Yup. Folks, by the way, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to build a wall and who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to pay for the wall?\\n[Audience: \"Mexico\"]\\nYou better believe it. We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion. And these characters come up, these politicians that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m running against, \"You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really think Mexico is going to pay for the wall?\" I said, \"Absolutely, 100%.\" They said, \"How are you going to get Mexico to pay?\" And I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to get into it because they won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand it. I mean, they have no concept of business. They have no \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, the $150 billion we gave to Iran, these people have no concept.\\nWe have a $58 billion trade deficit with Mexico. Okay? The wall is going to cost $12 billion. Maybe less. If I build it, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be taller, better, and less. Okay?\\nSo you think of this. So you think of this. So they said, \"How are you going to possibly do it?\"\\nThey make so much money. Plus we give them subsidy. They make so much money from the United States it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be one of the easiest things.\\nAnd I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard, one of the presidents or ex-presidents of Mexico held a news conference. He said, \"We will never ever, ever pay for the wall.\" And the press called me. They said, \"They said they will never pay for the wall.\" I said, \"Who was it?\" Calderon. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very nice, good guy. I said, \"Tell him the following. The wall just got 10 feet higher.\" I mean it. It got 10 feet higher. Yeah, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to pay for it.\\nAnd I get along great with Mexico. The problem is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I mean, they buy apartments. I have hundreds and hundreds and even thousands of workers are Hispanics who I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing great with. We have such an amazing relationship with Hispanics and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re great people.\\nThe problem is the leaders of Mexico are too smart for our leaders. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re too smart. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re too cunning.\\nYou look at what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unbelievable. The border is a disaster. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a sieve. People flow over. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen anymore, folks. People can come into our country but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to come in legally. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to come in through a process. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to come in, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to come in legally.\\nSo with trade, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to solve the trade problem. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if you saw Carrier air conditioner announced two days ago they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re moving to Mexico. Nabisco. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re moving their big plant from Chicago to Mexico. Ford, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re moving this massive complex \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re building a $2.5 billion plant and now they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve just announced they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re building it bigger.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been talking about this for two years. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal, they announced they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re building it bigger. In another words, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doubling down. You know why? Nobody does anything about it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do something about it.\\nSo I watched \\xe2\\x80\\x93 somebody asked, \"What would you do about Carrier?\" Because that was a sad case. Somebody used their cell phone and they were telling them, \"You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re out of work. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re out of job. Forget it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s over. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re moving to Mexico.\" Are crying. Grown men that have been there for a long time. Really incredible people. And they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re crying and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re devastated and they lost their job and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never had another job and now this plant \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this whole thing is moving to Mexico.\\nAnd they said, \"What would you do?\" I said I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do because you know they talk about free trade. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a free trader. But I say oh if I put a tax on these characters \\xe2\\x80\\x93 these idiots. I mean, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re like stupid. They say \"Donald Trump is not a true conservative because he taxes.\" It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to be fair stuff, folks. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to be fair. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a conservative person.\\nHey, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the most conservative on the border. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the most conservative with the military. Nobody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tougher than me. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the most conservative. We are going to make our military so big, so strong, so powerful, nobody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ever going to mess with us, folks. We won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to use it.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the most conservative on taking care of the vets. Our vets are treated horribly. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take care of our \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the most conservative on Common Core. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re ending Common Core \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I told you that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re moving it locally. And nobody is more conservative and we call toughness but nobody is more conservative on the Second Amendment. So all of these things.\\nBut with Carrier...they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re coming across and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to build a plant and probably get some subsidies from Mexico \\xe2\\x80\\x93 probably \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve probably given them subsidies. They probably have the United States giving subsidies to move out of the country. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how stupid it is and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how stupid we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re running...They said, \"What would you do?\" I say it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very easy. We call them. We say let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s have a meeting. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the story folks. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re moving to Mexico. Congratulations. But if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stay in the United States you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have a problem. But here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what you do it. You want to move to Mexico, build your factory, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be wonderful. Hire your people they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not from the United States. All those people are now looking for jobs. Those are good jobs. You know we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re hiring a lot of part-timers now...The numbers are totally phony. The 5% \\xe2\\x80\\x93 totally phony numbers. So I say here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do. Very simple. You build your plant in Mexico. Enjoy yourselves. And you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have air conditioners and just have them cross the border and sell them to the United States? No, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to pay a 35% tax on every air conditioner. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the only thing you can do.\\nAnd you know what? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the only thing you can do. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing else. Because otherwise how are you going to get them to stop?\\nAnd then you have the devaluation with China. The all-time. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re like grand chess masters or grand \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I mean these people are the greatest \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the greatest in history. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re grandmasters of that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 devaluation. They devalue their currency.\\nJapan is doing very well too. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re killing Caterpillar. You know, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re ordering Komatsu tractors now because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve devalued \\xe2\\x80\\x93 look, you take a look at what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happened to the Yen and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very hard. A friend a mine. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a big excavator. You all know excavators. I love excavators. This guy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very big one. He buys Caterpillar tractors all the time and excavators. He just put in a big order for Komatsu. Not that he wanted to. He said, \"Donald, they made it impossible for me not to buy. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve devalued the yen to such an extent \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Japan \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that it made it, I mean, I owe it to my family, to my company, to myself. I have no choice.\" And he was like depressed. He wanted to buy Caterpillar...\\nWell China is doing that times 100, times 1,000, and what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing is the devaluation of their currency makes it impossible for people to compete. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t allow that stuff to happen.\\nLook, when we send stuff over to China, it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get in. If it does get in, you have to pay a big tax. You know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not supposed to be that way. You know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supposed to be free trade. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supposed to be they come we go, back and forth. They devalued their currency and on top of it, they make it impossible.\\nI have a friend who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great manufacturer. He said it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s virtually impossible to get his goods and he makes better stuff than they do. He can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get his goods into China. When he does get them in, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a tax to pay.\\nI have a friend who actually bought an airplane and he can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get it into China because the tax is so massive. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to sell it now at a big loss. Okay?\\nAnd think about Boeing. Okay? Think about Boeing. Boeing is building a plant over here. Boeing just had a big order from China. But China is making them build a massive airline facility. Right? Massive. Like bigger than anything you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen.\\nOkay, you feel good about Boeing right now. Tell me in five years. Unless I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m president. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be fine. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry about it. But tell me in five years you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to feel good about Boeing because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening. They are going to build that plant \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re building it, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be finished soon \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to build that plant, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to devalue the hell out of their currency, and all of a sudden you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be reading a big front page story all over the place that Boeing is going to leave, right, South Carolina, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make all their planes in China. Because this is what they do. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what they do. And our leaders aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t smart enough to stop it, okay?\\nI have Carl Icahn endorse me. Great businessman, very rich guy, very, very successful. If I told Carl, Carl, watch over China trade, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be in great shape.\\nWe have right now people that have no concept of what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing. They have no concept of what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re political hacks. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what they are. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re political hacks and these are the people that are negotiating with these people China. And again, China likewise, I get along great with China. Largest bank in the world my tenant. They buy condos for tens of millions of dollars. I have the Bank of America building in California. I own a big chunk of that. I got that through China through a very complex set of transactions but through China.\\nI mean, I think China is terrific. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not angry at China. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m angry at our leaders for not being able to compete with China. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not angry.\\nSo we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get things changed around. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to use our best people. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be so smart, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to start winning again. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have strong borders. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have strong military. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take care of our vets. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have such great trade deals. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win again. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win again. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win so much.\\nAnd you know, and by the way, we are going to get rid of ISIS and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get rid of them fast.\\nI was against the war in Iraq from the beginning. I was against the war in Iraq. We shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have done it. We did it. Then Obama got out the wrong way. We shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have done Iraq. We did it. It destabilized the Middle East. Exactly. If you go back, you could see 2003, 2004, I said it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to totally destabilize the Middle East because you had Iran and Iraq and they were the same militarily. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99d fight, fight, fight. Boom. Then they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rest. Then they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d fight, fight, fight for years and years and years. We decapitated Iraq and now Iran is taking over. Not only do they get the $150 billion. Maybe the worst transaction I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen negotiated. No, no, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t buy the famous Obama administration.\\nThe worst, one of the dumbest deals I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen. I mean, we get nothing. We get nothing.\\nWe should have gotten those hostages before we started even negotiating. Not now. We should have gotten them years ago.\\nBut if you look at what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on and now on top of that we gave them Iraq because Iran is now taking over Iraq. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just taking them over.\\nSo here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we did. We spent $2 trillion, thousands of lives lost, wounded warriors who we all love all over the place. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the best people. Most incredible. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re tougher than all of us these people. I mean, what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gone through. So the wounded warriors all over the place. You know what we have? We have nothing. We have nothing. We have absolutely nothing. So here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to change things around. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be smart. And we have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do what we have to do in terms of ISIS and all. But we have to start rebuilding our country.\\nWe have $4 trillion in the various places. $4 trillion. Not going to happen anymore.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have a strong military. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have to rebuild our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our schools, our hospitals.\\nI mean, our country is like a third world country. You go over to Qatar, you go over to some of these places in the Middle East. You go to China. You see the airports. You see the bridges. They have bridges that are so incredible you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never seen anything like it. They have railroad trains that go 350 miles an hour and we have things that go chug, chug, chug, chug like from 100 years ago.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve become like a third world nation because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re fighting everybody else\\xe2\\x80\\x99s battles. And remember this, we are like the policemen of the world but we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get paid anything. We protect Germany. We protect Japan. Do you know that in Japan if we get attacked, we have a treaty with Japan, if we get attacked they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to do anything. If they get attacked, we have World War III, we have to protect them. Okay? I mean, who makes these deals?\\nWe protect as an example South Korea, who have a maniac right next to them. Right? But we protect South Korea. So every time we order televisions, they come from South Korea, they make a fortune. We protect South Korea. Let me tell you something. Why aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they paying? They pay peanuts for what we do.\\nEvery time this guy, you know, raises his head, we see our ships start to sail, our soldiers get ready. We have 28,000 soldiers at the border.\\nSo we take care of the world. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get it.\\nSaudi Arabia, before the oil went down, they were making $1 billion a day. $1 billion a day. And we rent space there so we can help them. We rent military bases. We pay rent. And yet without us they wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t last for two weeks. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be gone.\\nSo we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to change all that stuff folks. I mean, I want to be good. We want to be fair. We want to have heart. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to let these Syrian folks in that we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know who they are. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know where they come from. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not coming into this country. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not coming in.\\nI mean, there are a lot of them. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if you know it. You have a lot of them moving into South Carolina. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. Have you heard this? And you ought to tell your governor don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let them move to South Carolina. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want them in South Carolina.\\nAnd I know they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say, \"Well, we have nothing to do. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re state government.\" Let me tell you something. If a governor from a state didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to have them, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care what it says, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to have them...\\nWe want to help them with safe zones. We want to get the Gulf States to pay. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to pay. We owe $19 trillion. We owe enough. We can lead it but let the Gulf States \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they have so much money they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what to do with it. Let them build safe zones.\\nLook at what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening in Germany. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a mess. Look at Sweden. Look at Brussels. I mean, Brussels, you go there 20 years ago, 15 years ago it was incredible.\\nSo when I call for moratoriums and I call for this, first I get hit with tremendous heat. Right? Then everybody starts to say, \"You know, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right.\"\\nSame thing \\xe2\\x80\\x93 on June 16th, I announced we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to stop illegal immigration. The heat I took was unbelievable. Three, four weeks later they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all saying, you know, Trump is right. Then Kate killed in San Francisco, beautiful Kate, by an illegal immigrant. You have Jamiel in Los Angeles killed. Incredible guy. Young man. The father\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a friend of mine \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a great guy. You had the veteran \\xe2\\x80\\x93 65-year-old woman \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a veteran raped, sodomized, and killed in Los Angeles by an illegal immigrant. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to stop it folks. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to stop it. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to be smart. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to be a country again. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to be a country again.\\nSo I just want to thank \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this endorsement meant so much to me from these two guys and from the whole community. I just want to say get out and vote. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do something you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be so happy with. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win so much and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make America great again. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we want to do. Make America great again. So Saturday, get out and vote. Thank you! We love you all. Thank you very much! Thank you. Thank you very much folks.\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really think \\xe2\\x80\\x93 look, what happened is we had 17 candidates originally. I was expected to come in like anywhere maybe 10, 11, 12, 13. I ended up coming in second. Didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t devote tremendous time to it. Didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t devote tremendous money to it.\\nIn fact, I guess in terms of money per vote, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m about at the bottom, meaning the most efficient.\\nI came in second. I came into strong second. Third, I think, was quite a bit away \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I think 2,500 or something \\xe2\\x80\\x93 close to 3,000 votes away. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a big difference between second and third.\\nI think we did really well. You know, as far as that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s concerned.\\nI think the press \\xe2\\x80\\x93 some of the press said I did fantastically well. Some of the press doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to give it credit.\\nI think we did very well. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expect to do so well. I guess what did happen is one poll came out and said I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m 4 or 5 points ahead and that maybe build up a false expectation for some people.\\nBut it had taken me back to June 16th. I was told \"Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even go to Iowa. Start right here in New Hampshire. Just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t waste your \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"\\n...I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to Iowa. I went. I bonded with the people, bonded with evangelicals. We did really fantastically and came very close to winning. I mean, we came very close to winning. We came in second place.\\nSo I am very happy with what happened in Iowa. You know, you had 17 people and I was second. Now, I guess you have 11 people and I was second. And I think we did a very good job.\\nNo, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I feel any pressure. I mean, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to just do what I have to do. And if it works out, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great. And if it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s okay too because you know I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m here to do one thing \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the theme \\xe2\\x80\\x93 make America great again. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do it.\\nAnd I think we did very well \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I think we did really well in just about everything we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done running for office. I think we have a very good result yesterday. It could have been a little bit better. It could have been one notch better.\\nBut it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interesting all of these governors and senators that you have way down the list, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re at 1%, 2%, you know, in terms of what happened \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what just happened \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re at 1%, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re at 2%, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re 3%. Nobody ever talks about them. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m at 24% or 25%, and they say, \"Oh, couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you have done better?\"\\nYou know, I think the result was quite good especially for the amount of time I spent and for the amount of money I spent.\\nWell, I think I have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I think it fits me better, probably suits me better. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done very well in New Hampshire. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been here a lot more. I have very good relationships with the people of New Hampshire.\\nBut I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had very good relationships with pretty much everybody.\\nI really don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. I really don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see that happening. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to happen. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \\xe2\\x80\\x93 nobody does. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see what \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have many, many people that aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t doing very well. I am doing very well. But you have many, many people that are here, that are well-known politicians \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re governors and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re senators \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not doing very well. And they just came back from a, you know, very major defeat yesterday. And mine wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\n...You know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very interesting. If you look at the numbers from yesterday, I got the highest number in history outside the one number \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in the history of the primary.\\n...Also, I guess they had 185,000 people, which is 45,000 or 50,000 people more than they ever had.\\nNo, I mean, I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get a lot of Sanders\\xe2\\x80\\x99s voters. You know, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re very much into the trade world and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the best on trade. He mentions it but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be capable of doing anything about it.\\nNo, I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do really well here. I look forward to it.\\nWe have a lot of events scheduled, yes.\\nWell, we do. We have one commitment long-term for Arkansas actually where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have about 10,000 people. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be back and forth very quickly. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have a lot of events scheduled, yes.\\nWell, I just think, you know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m just happy with the way we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing. You know, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve bonded with the people whether it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s there or here. I mean, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just a big bonding process going on.\\nIf you look at South Carolina, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the same thing. I mean, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing really well there. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve devoted much more time here and South Carolina \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a question of learning. I mean, I just want to continue to do well...Our theme \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the theme is so important. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just make America great again. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do. Not really a question of learning.\\nWell, if you look at the second place, people didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk about my second place. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk about it as positively as they should have. And yet, with Marco who was more than 2,000 votes behind me \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot of votes by the way \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they said, \"Oh, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s surging. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s surging.\"\\nSo, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know why is the third place person doing well and the second place person, who by the way has never run \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Scott was mentioning before \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"One of the amazing things about you, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never run for office before. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s incredible how you did.\"\\nMy brand\\xe2\\x80\\x99s doing great. Yeah.\\nNo, I think just work. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to work very hard and we have a lot of meetings, a lot of talks, a lot of speeches. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be meeting with a lot of people and I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do very well.\\nWell, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be doing some of that but we also have some very big events planned like tonight, I think they have 4,000 or 5,000 people and other people were here yesterday and they had 200 people. Same venue, same everything. They had 200 people.\\nSo we have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good bonding going on.\\nWell, I enjoyed it.\\nI have unlimited, I have unlimited \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s funny. When I look at the various people, they said so and so has $20 million. I have unlimited. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the thing.\\nThe only \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a businessperson. I want to spend wisely. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m probably $40 million under budget because of the fact that frankly I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t had to spend very much although I guess we just did a recent filing and I would be probably having spent now maybe $14 million, $15 million.\\nBut I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m self-funding. And I must tell you, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that enough people appreciate it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m self-funding anyway whether they appreciate it or not. So I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be influenced by the lobbies and you know et cetera, et cetera.\\nBut I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I was talking to Scott about this before \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really appreciated by the voters. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the only one on both sides that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s self funding. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m putting up my own money. And I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that the voters appreciate it. When they go into vote, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think they say \"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to vote for Trump because he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s self-funding and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to be influenced by lobbies and special interests et cetera.\"\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to tell them and I tell them. But sometimes they like it but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something they vote for, which is a shame because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actually a very big thing. You understand that. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very big thing. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very big element if you could have somebody that can actually self-fund and not be influenced by bad decisions...or looking for themselves or looking for the company or country they represent. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a real positive...\\nI just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know whether or not the voters appreciate it.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve learned that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re great people. I really, I thought the people in Iowa were fantastic...You know, obviously I was second. I had the largest vote getting in the history of a Republican primary except for one and I brought many of those extra people in. And they also had as you know the largest turnout in the history of Republican primaries in terms of Iowa by far \\xe2\\x80\\x93 not even close. I think it was like 50,000 or 60,000 more than they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever had before. So I just \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I learned that they are terrific people in Iowa.\\nYeah, I look forward to it.\\n...No, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think so. I have a very good relationship with Marco. I like him... I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see that necessarily.\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about Iowa? Well, that could have been with the debate. I think it could have been the debate. I think some people were disappointed that I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go in the debate.\\nIf I had to do it again, I would have done the exact same thing. And the reason is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know why? Because I raised $6 million for the vets in one hour.\\nSo if I took a second place instead of a first place and could give the vets $6 million, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do that all day long.\\nWell, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be spending money. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be spending money \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be spending a lot of money. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be spending money on ads and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be spending money on the ground game.\\nI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help it, honey, whether I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m celebrity. I mean, this is me.\\nLook, I think most people say I did a great job in Iowa. I came in second. I spent far less than anybody else. And had I known that I was going to be liked as much as I am in Iowa and people did like me \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you will understand that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I would have maybe spent a little bit more and I would have been there a little bit more and maybe I would have won it. But, you know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very happy with it. I have 7 delegates right at the top.\\nYou look at other people in all fairness \\xe2\\x80\\x93 senators, governors \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re, you know, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re way down.\\nWhen I have 25% or 26% and they have 1% but you people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mention that.\\nBut the one thing is you people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mention that. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mention all the other names.\\nNow, you mention the person, Marco, good guy. But he came in third. And they make it sound like he had a victory and I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. But I came in second.\\n...I started off on 17th. I was 17th. When I first started, I had nothing. And then I inched my way up \\xe2\\x80\\x93 went pretty rapidly actually. And now I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m leading everything and I did okay in Iowa. Pretty good in Iowa.\\nWell, I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have great success here. I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a much different kind of a process. This isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a caucusing process. This is a much different \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this is a normal voting process. The Iowa is a much different kind of a thing.\\nWell, he [referring to Ted Cruz] insulted me. I mean, he started with the insults, as you know. And he insulted Ben Carson by doing what he did to Ben Carson. That was a disgrace. And he insulted the people of Iowa by doing a voter violation form that nobody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ever seen before which was disgraceful. No, no, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a man of insult.\\nNo, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going. I have thousands of people going. No, but we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have that invite. I like Mike Huckabee but no, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s even going to be there.\\nI did. I did. No, I like him. Well, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s left the race so I feel pretty good about that. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good man.\\nWell, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re adding some and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re adding them pretty rapidly.\\n...People in your world are saying they possibly could. So I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really see one or two. I see there could be a number.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d love to finish first. You know, again it would still not be horrible because you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re competing against a lot of very talented people that have been politicians all their lives. I have been a politician for 6 months.\\nNo, but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d love to finish first.\\nWouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t horrible but you know it wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be the worst thing in the world. I could think of worse things. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to finish first. I think we will finish first. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to finish first.\\n...Just so you understand. I am totally self-funding my campaign other than small donations because people send in small donations for $10, $15, $20...\\nNo, no, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s merchandise sales. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot of merchandise sales.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a small amount of money compared to what I put in.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very hard when somebody sends you a check for $17.50 and $9 and $200, very hard to send that back.\\nI am. And I always make the reference. I always make a reference to that and I do it every time.\\nWell, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s [referring to Scott Brown] somebody that I respect, always liked. And he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very, very respected throughout the country but he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very respected here. And everybody wanted his endorsement and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very honored that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s giving it to me and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to give it to me on the stage.\\nThat happens with endorsements. No, that happens with endorsement. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty common with endorsements.\\n...A poll came out a few days before that said I was about 5 points so maybe there was a tinge.\\nAnd again, it may have been the debate, which would have set records if I did it. So I would have liked that. But the fact is it could have been the debate. Maybe it is. Maybe it isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. But I would have done it exactly the same way because I raised, Scott, we raised in one hour, I raised $6 million for the vets. And I would never, ever give that up to go between first and second in Iowa. Wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be worth it.\\nI think her email situation is very serious. I have a feeling she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being protected by the Democrats because it just looks to me to be more serious than anybody that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen including Gen. Petraeus.\\nIf you watch and study and read about various lawyers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what they do \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they really feel she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in grave danger and what she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s done is against the law not just against rules. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s against the law. I just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to happen because I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know whether or not the Democrats are going to protect her.\\nI never saw a race where they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re flipping coins. I mean, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re flipping coins. What kind of a race is that? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ridiculous. I thought it was terrible. I mean, you call it a tie. But to flip coins, they say \"Okay, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get this district. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to flip a coin.\"\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell you yet. I think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s [referring to Ted Cruz] certainly was dirty what he did to Ben Carson was terrible. He did the voter violation form. I thought that was terrible. Actually, I thought it was terrible. And when they said that Ben Carson was out of the race and come vote for him, I thought that was terrible.\\nOkay?\\nThank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you.\\nWow, what a crowd. Thank you very much everybody. Such an honor. With the snow coming down and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a little cold outside and you have hundreds of people still outside trying to get in. But you know, we won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go ahead. Right?\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go ahead.\\nFirst of all, congratulations to the Iowa State basketball team. You had a \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what was that all about? I turned on the game. I said, \"Wow, this shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be that good of a game.\" And at the end of the game, I said, \"Who won?\" Yes? That was great and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great achievement.\\nI also want to pay my respects to Ben Carson. They had a really bad accident. Some of his staffers were hurt really bad. So I just want to pay my respects to Ben. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good guy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a really good guy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and his staffers and hopefully they get better. Say a prayer for them. Okay?\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had an amazing time today. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been all over Iowa and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be here tomorrow. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be here so much you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get so sick of me. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to say, \"Please, tell him to get out of here. Tell him to leave. Tell him to go.\"\\nBut we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had an incredible time.\\nAnd you know it started really \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had really a pretty good week. The debate last week \\xe2\\x80\\x93 everybody watched the debate. And who knew about these debates? I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know anything about the debates. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been fun and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been interesting. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been treated semi-fairly by the moderators. Not 100%. Some have been very fair actually, and some have been not so fair.\\nAnd you know, a lot of the press hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been very fair.\\nBoy, look at the press back there. They must think there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a big event going happen today. Wow, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot of them \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like the Academy Awards.\\nBut we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had an amazing \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been an amazing experience and it started really on June 16th when we came down the escalator. We came down that escalator and it was \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I said, \"Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go\" to my wife, who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been so supportive and so wonderful. I said, \"Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make America great again. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do.\"\\nAnd you know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to do this because when you think of it I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never done it before. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never been a politician. Thank goodness but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never been a politician. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve always done jobs and put a lot of people to work. Tens of thousands of people over the years.\\nAnd you know, I have thousands of Hispanics that love me. The Nevada poll just came out where I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m leading with Hispanics, which I knew, I knew.\\nAnd we came out at that particular opening when I opened and said I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to run for president I gave up a lot. You know, gave up a lot of different things including telling our friends at NBC no more Apprentice. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to do. You have a top show and you say, \"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not doing it anymore. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sorry.\" They wanted to do it so badly.\\nAnd Steve Burke, who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a fantastic executive, came up to my office and said \"Come on, Donald. Come on. Do it. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to run. Do it. Do it.\" I said, \"Steve, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to run.\" I was pretty sure. You know, that was about two months before. I was pretty sure. It really is a tough thing to do.\\nYou know, all my life I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard \"If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a very successful person, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never run for president. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never really run for politics. But you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never ever run for president.\"\\nAnd I built a great company and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a tremendous number. You saw the filings. The press was going to look so closely. It was like D-Day when we put those papers in.\\nYou know, first thing I did I announced. They said, \"Oh, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actually going to do it\" because most of them said \"He\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never do it.\"\\nThen when I signed...that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s when you sign your life away. And I signed that. They said, \"Whoa! He signed that. Well, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never file his financials because maybe he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not as rich as everybody thinks.\"\\nAnd I filed the financials and they saw an unbelievable \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hear a thing about it. Oh boy, were they looking. I mean, were they looking. And almost 100 pages. The biggest report ever filed with the FEC in terms of that. And it showed a company that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a phenomenal company with some of the great assets, very little debt, tremendous cash flow. You know, the way it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supposed to be. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great.\\nAnd the reason I tell you that is because that is the kind of thinking we need now in the United States. We need that kind of thinking. We need that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 whatever it is. We need a mentality that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re at $19 trillion in debt. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be up to $21 trillion. You saw that horrible budget. Horrible, horrible budget that was approved two weeks ago and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to lift it.\\nAnd so we went along and a lot of things have happened and then the polls came out which I love and new ones came out today and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you right now. You know, now that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re at it. And they came out some brand new ones \\xe2\\x80\\x93 some beauties. And one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming out \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I guess a big one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming out. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know exactly what it is but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to be pretty good because I see the response.\\nI mean, even this with all the people still trying to come into this building. Somebody said it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a barn. This is a very nice barn actually. But with all of the people still trying to come in, you see what it is.\\nAnd we do have something special in a couple of minutes. To me, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really special because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a person that I think is a spectacular person. So it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very special to me.\\nBut then the polls came out and some of them \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as an example \\xe2\\x80\\x93 national polls 38% for Trump, 20% for second. I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even names. Right? I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even mention names. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to be non-confrontational today for a change.\\n21% for the second. 11%. And then they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all down. Some of them are actually at 0% and 1%. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know.\\nJeb \\xe2\\x80\\x93 well, you know, Jeb\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got one problem. He loves Common Core, meaning he wants your kids educated from Washington, which is immediately no good.\\nAnd his second problem is he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very weak on illegal immigration. Remember, he said they come as an act of love. I said, \"What? They come as an act of love?\"\\nSo I think those are two very bad points frankly.\\n...So South Carolina just came out and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 32% for Trump, 18% for second, 11% for third. Great.\\nFlorida leading by a lot \\xe2\\x80\\x93 31%, 19%, 13%, and then all down in the dumps.\\nGeorgia just came out. I have 33%.\\nYeah, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 33%. Hard to believe. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s with 14 people, 15 people. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know when they took it but it was recent. 33%.\\nConnecticut \\xe2\\x80\\x93 now, Tom Brady loves me and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sort of like, you know, and I love Tom Brady by the way. 35% to 18% to 9% to 2%. You know, to nothing.\\nMaryland just came out. Maryland \\xe2\\x80\\x93 great place \\xe2\\x80\\x93 32% to 15% to 11% to 9% and then you know they sort of phase out.\\nYou ever hear of a place called Iowa? Oh, I love this. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing actually great. First of all, I have to tell you. You know, they never report it. Even CNN doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t report it. CNN does a poll, probably spent millions, they never report their poll.\\nThe CNN poll was 33% for Trump, 20% for Chris. Nobody talks about it. Nobody talks about it. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk about it. They talk about \\xe2\\x80\\x93 CNN is reporting other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s polls. So, I call up. I say, \"Wait a minute. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re CNN. You spent a fortune on polls and you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t report your own polls because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m winning by a lot.\" And they have no excuse but they keep reporting other polls. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing well. I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing a lot better than anyone knows.\\nGravis just came out \\xe2\\x80\\x93 34% for Trump, 28% for Cruz. PPP 28% for Trump, 26% for Cruz. In other words, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a little close here. Quinnipiac poll \\xe2\\x80\\x93 very respected 31% for Trump, 29% for Cruz. And then again CNN 33% to 20%.\\nSo we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing good. I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re actually doing better than the polls.\\nNow, I could do this. I could say, \"Well, I just want to do well in Iowa.\" I want to win Iowa, folks. Because look, I love the people. The evangelicals have been phenomenal. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing great with the evangelicals but nationwide I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m winning with evangelical \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if you know that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 by a lot nationwide.\\nWith Iowa, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing really well with the evangelicals. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing really well with the Tea Party. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing well \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I mean, you hear the numbers. I mean, these are the numbers.\\nBut I actually think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing even better than the polls. And you know, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the thing that a lot of people said, you know, they call up, \"Are you going to vote for Trump? He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got very, very tough immigration policies. He wants to destroy Obamacare and replace it with something a lot better.\" I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do that. Okay?\\nBut you know, a lot of people, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll pick up the phone and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll hear different things and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say, \"Uh, no I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll vote for \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \" and then they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d get in the booth and they say, \"Trump is my man.\" There are a lot of people saying that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do a lot better. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see because Feb. 1st you have to get to caucus, you have to go out. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to do it. Otherwise, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve all wasted our time.\\nYou know, one of the groups in Maine and it was like incredible. We were in different places up in New England recently and New Hampshire was amazing. And the people are standing there. It was so cold. There was one little group of \\xe2\\x80\\x93 despite global warming \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, you hear about \"It was so cold.\" It was windchill below zero. And people were standing outside for hours trying to get in.\\nAnd then you hear the announcers. \"Well, will they show up to vote?\" And I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know much but I say like if people are going to stand out for four hours in the cold or the heat because believe me they stood out in the heat during the summer and during the fall like you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe in Tennessee, in Texas where we had 21,000 people, no matter where we go we have these big crowds but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll stand for hours and hours to get in. Why aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they going to go and vote? Or in your case caucus? Why aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they going to go and vote? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sort of an amazing thing. So we think they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to really be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 why would somebody wait for hours for four hours and not going to take two minutes to vote?\\nNow, yours is a little more complicated because the caucus system is a little bit different. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very interesting system. But it is different.\\nHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I have to say about Iowa. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very important.\\nSo you know there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a movement to move Iowa to the back of the pack. Okay? You know that. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll still see me but you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see other people. Believe me. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m loyal. To a fault I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m loyal.\\nBut you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to see. I give you my word. I win; they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not touching Iowa. This is an amazing tradition. No, seriously. This is an amazing tradition. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not moving Iowa back.\\nAnd they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not moving New Hampshire either because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about Iowa, New Hampshire. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not touching New Hampshire.\\nSo, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to just keep it the way it is. It really is. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an amazing. First of all, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re amazing people. But all over the country it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a movement all over the country. The people are incredible. They want to make America great again. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do something that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s special.\\nAnd you know we used to talk silent majority? I say it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the noisy majority because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actually a noisy majority. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a silent majority.\\nBut people are fed up.\\nSo I started on June 16th and we did well. Practically from the beginning we went up. And if you remember, we started at nothing. You know, we started at nothing because nobody believed I was going to [run]. Even when they \\xe2\\x80\\x93 my wife said, \"You know if you run, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win.\" I said, \"What do you mean?\" She said, \"People don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to run.\" At the polls. I was getting these little polls. I felt like some of these guys now that are senators and governors; they get these little polls.\\n...Jeb again, right? Boy, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s taking a lot of abuse. You know? I told him \"You know what? You should use the name Bush. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrong? Use the name Bush. I mean, maybe it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not working but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s better than Jeb right?\" You know, I really do. Get rid of the exclamation point and just put Jeb Bush. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s your name. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be ashamed of your name.\\nSo anyways, I wish him the best.\\nBut, you know, I started and I started at like 2% or 3% and then it went to 6% and then it went to 9%. And each time the pundits \\xe2\\x80\\x93 these real geniuses back here \\xe2\\x80\\x93 some of them are sitting back here \\xe2\\x80\\x93 these real geniuses like George Will with the little glasses \\xe2\\x80\\x93 take away the glasses. He looks like a dumb guy, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m telling you.\\nBut each time these geniuses would say, \"Well, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reached his plateau. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plateaued\" at 6%, right? Then it goes to 11%. \"Well, you know, this is surprising but he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reached his plateau.\" And then it goes to 18%. And then it went to 22%, 24%, 28%, then it went to 32%. Then it went actually 42% in the Gravis poll and in Reuters we got to 42% and even a little above that. And then all of a sudden you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hear so much about the plateau.\\nI want to plateau at 42%. You know, 42% with like 14 people that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretty good.\\nBut they kept saying, \"He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plateaued. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got these followers.\"\\nWe have the smartest followers there are. Number one, we have the smartest. And the hardest working followers. We have people that love the country more than anybody and they want to take back what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happened because our country is going to hell.\\nWe can be nice about it. We can say it nice and soft. Our country is going to hell.\\nWhen you look at this crazy Iran deal where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re paying $150 billion and they give us the five back but they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know where the fifth is and you understand what that means. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a good sign. But they give us five people but they get seven and they get 14 off the Interpol. These are bad dudes. They get 14 plus seven so they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting 21 people. And they have the right to do whatever they want from an enterprise standpoint. Right to do oil. Right to do whatever they want.\\nBut what do they also get out of that deal? First of all, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get nuclear. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to develop nuclear missiles. They can buy them. For the kind of money we gave them, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to buy them. Why are they going to develop?\\nRemember the deal? 24 days. They have 24 days for inspection period. They also have self-inspection. Right? But we paid $150 billion. And I always say, \"Wow. What a great \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the Persians are great negotiators.\" I say what a great deal that is.\\n...Two weeks ago I started. I said, \"Wait a minute. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a good deal compared to the other deal.\" They took over Iraq. We gave them Iraq. We knocked the hell out of Iraq. We decimated their armed forces. And you know, for years, they would fight. For many, many years, for decades they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d fight, fight, fight. Nobody would win. Fight. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rest. Then they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d go back to fight.\\nAnd now, we gave them the second largest oil reserves in the world, which is Iraq. We gave it to them. Now, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going into Yemen. And if you look at Yemen, take a look. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get Syria. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get Yemen.\\nUnless, you know, trust me a lot of good things are going to happen if I get in. But let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just sort of leave it the way it is.\\nThey get Syria. They get Yemen. Now, they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want Yemen. But did you ever see the border between Yemen and Saudi Arabia? They want Saudi Arabia.\\nSo, what are they going to have? They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have Iraq. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have Iran. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have Iraq. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have Yemen. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have Syria. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have everything. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be a monster. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve created this. We have stupid leadership. Really stupid leadership.\\nSo when I started, I said we have to do something about it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not something I wanted to do. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something we have to do.\\nBecause I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m representing you. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not taking any money. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not, you know, like some of these guys where they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting millions and millions of dollars from people I know and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re nice people and some are very bad people but they have no interest in the country. They have interests in their company or they have interests in countries they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re representing.\\nAnd these people and these politicians are going to do exactly as they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re told by their lobbyists, their special interests, and their donors.\\nMe, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do the right thing.\\nAnd I always tell the story. When Ford moves to Mexico, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to talk them out of it. When Nabisco moves its plant from Chicago to Mexico, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to talk them out of it. Believe me. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be easy. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be easy.\\nSo, I started and I talked about the border. Very strong on immigration and illegal immigration. Took a lot of heat. But you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even be talking about that subject if I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bring it up.\\nAnd I talked about again I talked about ISIS and I talked about. But what really happened is after Paris we had 130 people killed.\\nAnd by the way, I told you Common Core is dead and Second Amendment is right this way. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to protect the Second Amendment. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to protect the guns. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to protect your guns.\\nYou know, if in Paris and if in Los Angeles, we had the two maniacs that were married. She came on a fiancee permit...You know, wonderful fiancee. She was totally radicalized. Maybe radicalized him. Maybe he was already that way. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to start thinking. We have to start using our head. Bad stuff is happening. We have to find out what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on.\\nWe have a president who won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even talk about the term. If you think, he won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even mention anything to do with what we all know is going on. And you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t solve the problem if you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk about it. You have to talk about it.\\nSo, very, very strongly we started talking about that. And then after Paris \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and by the way, if we had a couple of you and you and you and you, if we had three or four people in that room in Paris as an example where they have the toughest gun laws like in the world. You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a gun unless you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re bad guy, you bought a gun. And they walked in just said \"Boom! Boom! Boom! You, move over. Boom!\" Killed 130, more to follow because there are people that are so badly wounded.\\nBut if we had a couple of \\xe2\\x80\\x93 few of the people that I pointed out \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I could plenty in this audience, believe me. But if they had guns on their waist, if they had guns around their ankle where the bullets went the opposite direction, it would have been a whole different story, folks. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be a whole different story.\\nSo very, very big on the Second Amendment. But what happened is all of a sudden after Paris and to an extent, to a pretty big extent in California, what happened is these polls started coming in where everybody liked Trump even more. I went up 11 points. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to do it for that reason.\\nBut it went up because people want strength just like having the family of John Wayne, who was great. I love John Wayne. From Iowa. But out of nowhere I got the most beautiful letter from his daughter, who you just met, who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an incredible woman, and she said, \"We\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to endorse you.\"\\nJohn Wayne was a strong guy. We need strength. We need strength in this country because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re withering away with political correctness nonsense. Okay? Nonsense.\\nI mean, if you think of it, you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say \"Merry Christmas\" anymore. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to say \"Merry Christmas\" again. You go into these department stores. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any Christmas displays. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the sign \"Merry Christmas\". Even people that aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t Christian are saying \"Merry Christmas. We love Christmas. Let us say \\xe2\\x80\\x98Merry Christmas\\xe2\\x80\\x99, Happy Holidays.\" But people like to see it. And stores don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t put it up anymore. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re withering away. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going in the wrong direction.\\nSo I said we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do this and I had no idea it was going to work this way. I figured I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be in the pack and maybe like a race horse. You know, just at the end you can sort of inch it out. I had no idea to have 21 point leads nationally. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re up by so much. And you know, I want to keep it that way. I want to keep it that way.\\nWhen you think \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and just one thing before I introduce our incredible person, our incredible guest. But one thing \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve spent to this point almost nothing and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in first place by a lot. I tell this story. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not bragging about spending. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m just saying I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m telling the story. I have spent \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you \\xe2\\x80\\x93 almost nothing and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in first place by some polls have me 21 points. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot. Okay? You know some people have 2%. I have a lead of 20%. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in first place by a lot.\\nJeb has spent now $77 million. Think of it.\\nAnd you know the reason I bring him up \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even bring him up \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but he spends a fortune on ads against me. You people have all seen it before\\nI got along with everybody. I contributed to everybody. I was a world class businessman. Now I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a politician, which I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d hate to tell you. But you go with everybody. You want to love everybody. You want them all to love you unless you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re stupid. But you want everybody to love you.\\nEverybody knows this story. But so much money has been spent on me. But he spent $79 million. I spend nothing. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in first by a lot. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s down towards the bottom of the pack.\\nAnd I said to myself, \"It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amazing. Wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that be great if this were the country doing this?\"\\nAs an example, education. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re number 28 in the world. We have third world countries that are ahead of us. Education is very important to me.\\nWorld, I mean, countries that you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe are ahead of us. You wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe if you heard the names of some of these countries. So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re 28. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re number one in spending per pupil by far.\\nWouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it be nice if you had like this election process where we spent the least but we had the best education? You know?\\nSo Sweden and Norway and China and others are the best. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re nowhere near them and yet we spend far more per pupil. So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to change that and I told you we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get it localized but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to change that. Watch, you just watch...\\nI will tell you this: You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t educate your children through bureaucrats in Washington. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what happens with Common Core.\\nWhen the parents take over and I really mean this because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen it. When the parents surround those schools and they love those kids and they love those pupils and even when their kids graduate, they are committed to those schools, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re committed to education. You can do so much better in Iowa than they can possibly do telling you what to do in Washington.\\nAnd not all of them but most of them are just interested in \"Where\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my check? How much do I get? Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s make the process complicated.\"\\nAnd some of the things that your kids are made to study are an outrage. Okay? So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to bring that back locally and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be great.\\nSo what happened essentially is I started looking and all of a sudden things changed. And people are now looking. They know I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do great with China. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do great with Japan. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do great with Mexico, who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s killing us in trade and killing us also at the border.\\nWe will build a wall and you know who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to pay for the wall \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Mexico. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to pay for it because they make a fortune and all of those things.\\nBut now, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re really focused on security and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m honored because I will tell you that all of polls and the CNN polls where said in particular that Trump is just not by a little bit but by many, many percentage points winning on ISIS, winning on the military, winning with the vets. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take care of our vets big league, by the way. Big league. Big league. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to really take care of our military. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be big and strong and powerful and nobody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to mess with us and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the cheapest thing we can do, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you that right now.\\nSo it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been a real focus.\\nI just want to now say just a couple of words about a very special person. This is a person who I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve known for a long time, who I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve respected for so long. An incredible husband. An incredible family. And somebody that when I heard that she was going to endorse me, I was so honored. You have no idea how honored.\\nAnd I would like to bring up if I might Gov. Sarah Palin. Special, special person. Thank you.\\n  \\n(AUDIENCE MEMBERS SHOUTING)\\n \\xe2\\x80\\x94 let me just tell you \\xe2\\x80\\x94 let me just tell you a little secret. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the cheapest thing we can do. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re never going to have to use it. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have to use it. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget they talk about my tone. I remember when Jeb and Hillary the same day \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tone is not nice. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re chopping off Christians\\xe2\\x80\\x99 heads in Syria and other places and they want me to have a nice tone. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m supposed to be, oh, isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t life wonderful, OK?\\n Look, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to be tough, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to be smart, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to have heart too. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to have heart, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to take care of people. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to fix our health care program. This Obamacare is a disaster. You people know.\\nYou people know. Obamacare is a total catastrophe. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be repealed and replaced. It will die in \\xe2\\x80\\x9917 anyway. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if you heard what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so bad, all the people that they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think were signing up are signing up.\\nAnd the other people that are really paying for it are not signing up. And your rates are going up 25 percent, 35 percent, 45 percent. Your deductibles are so high that unless you get hit by a tractor, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re never going to be able to use your deductible. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re never going to be able to use it. So Obamacare is a disaster. We are going to repeal it, we are going to replace it.\\nThere are so many great things we can do on health care. So many good things.\\n  \\nWow. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you.\\nWe start by paying our great respects to Pearl Harbor.\\nWe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want that stuff. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want World Trade Centers. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want that ever happen to us again. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen to us again.\\nSo I want to thank everybody for being here. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great honor.\\nThey have thousands of people outside and sometimes they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say \"Would you like to wait about an hour until they all come in?\" But we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get them in anyways so what difference there. We all got lucky. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re together tonight. Thank you.\\nSo we have a lot of big news today. To me, very big was CNN just came out with a new poll about an hour ago and Iowa \\xe2\\x80\\x93 great, great state \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and in Iowa, Trump 33%. Beating everybody by a lot. You have Cruz at 20% and Carson at 16% and going down and Rubio at 11% and Bush at 4%. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Trump at 33%. It just came out. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Iowa \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we love Iowa.\\nBy the way, great ship named after Iowa too. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been on that one too. A really great one.\\nThe other big poll that came out just two days ago was the national poll. Trump 36% and then I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even mention the other numbers because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re so low.\\nYou know, when you have so many people running \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we had 17 and then they started to drop. Ding. Bing. I love it. I love it. And you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be losing a lot over the next little while. I would imagine. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. When somebody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s down at zero I would think that eventually they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll drop out. The only difference is there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing to pick up if there is zero. What do you pick up? So anyways you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be seeing that.\\nOne of the things I think that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so important because to me very important in the same poll, which is the big national CNN poll, on the economy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so important \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Trump 55%. Everyone else nothing.\\nOn the budget \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m really good at these things \\xe2\\x80\\x93 economy, budgets. I sort of expected this. On the budget, Trump \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this is with 15 people remaining \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Trump 51%. Everyone else bing.\\nOh, here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one that I started and I took a lot of heat. I took a lot of heat. Sort of like the one we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about today. I guess you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard a little bit about it. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve taken a lot of heat on this one. Illegal immigration. Now, had I not brought that up in Trump Tower in June when I announced that I was going to run for president, which takes courage to run for president, believe me.\\nYou know, all of my life, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard that if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a successful person, especially if you have very success \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done a lot of things, a lot of deals, a lot of everything, you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t run for president.\\nAnd yet, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the kind of mindset and thinking this country needs.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re being run by people that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing. Very sad.\\nOn illegal immigration, Trump 48%. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s with 15 people. Everyone else, no good.\\nOn a thing called ISIS\\xe2\\x80\\xa6oh, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have plenty \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll talk a lot about ISIS. Can you believe it?\\nHere we have generals. They go on television and talk. They do all talk. You people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a lot of military people here. Who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s military here? All right, I love you.\\nBy the way, speaking of it, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make our military so strong, so powerful, so great, nobody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ever going to mess with us again. Nobody. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re never going to mess with us.\\nYou know in many ways, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the cheapest thing we can do. The cheapest thing. Instead of fighting these wars that we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing and we have leaders that are afraid to do anything, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make it so great, so strong that people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 gosh, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not messing. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not messing.\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take care of our great vets, our wounded warriors. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take care of them. Because they \\xe2\\x80\\x93 thank you, they are not being taken care of.\\nWe have illegal immigrants that are taken care of better than our incredible veterans and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen any longer. Not going to happen. Not going to happen.\\nSo with ISIS \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Trump 46%. Can you imagine that? With all of these characters running.\\nOn foreign policy, Trump way up. And you know, in theory you could say \"Well, maybe it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not my thing.\" But people want to see strong, they want to see strength, they want to see protection, they want to be protected. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s it.\\nI watched last night and I watched the president truly that didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what he was doing. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know why he was there. He refuses to use the term \"radical Islamic terrorism\". He refuses to use the term.\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know if he knows what the hell is going on. I really don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\nAnd then we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking at Hillary Clinton. Honestly, I know Hillary. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just going to be an extension of Obama. I think maybe worse.\\nShe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got no strength. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got no stamina. Remember that.\\nYou don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need a president with no strength or stamina when we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re being ripped off on trade, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re being ripped off on Obamacare, which is going to be repealed and replaced by something really good.\\nWhen our soldiers aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t being taken care of, when our military is never been like it is today.\\nOne of the generals was on television, as usual, saying that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the least prepared now than anytime that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ever seen it and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been there a long time retiring. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how we are.\\nIn the most dangerous world we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever had because of the power of weapons, we have people that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m telling you. I watch them. I watch these generals being interviewed.\\nDo you think Gen. George Patton would be interviewed?\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6They\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be interviewed after total and complete victory.\\nGen. Douglas MacArthur. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not big for interviews. You know, they shoot first, they talk later.\\nThese guys \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to.\\nYou know, just so you understand, Bush \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Bush, he said yesterday he was being interviewed, he said that he was talking about me. He was saying the nicest things about me. Of course, he says he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be elected. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s at what 3%? Right?\\nNo, but he said some things and I was like \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I said \"Who says that about an opponent? You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say those things.\" You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find out what he said. But he said very nice things.\\nBut, if you look at what happens where he is upset with me because he says the tone \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the tone \\xe2\\x80\\x93 of Donald Trump is not nice.\\nAnd I say it all the time. We have people whose heads are being chopped off in the Middle East because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re Christian and for other reasons. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re being dumped and drowned in steel cages. And we talk about my tone.\\nHillary said the same thing. \"Mr. Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tone is not nice.\"\\nThese people are living in a different planet. Different planet.\\nAnd remember what I said about Hillary. We need somebody who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strong. We need somebody with incredible energy but incredible intelligence and all of those things.\\nYou know, I know a lot of tough people but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not smart. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no good. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re easy.\\nWe need tough. We need smart. We need like every character. We are so far behind the eight ball in this country.\\nWe owe $19 trillion. The budget they signed two weeks ago is going to make it $21 trillion. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a \\xe2\\x80\\x93 think of it. Trillion. Trillion. Trillion dollars. Who the hell ever heard of the word 10 years ago? There was no such word.\\nWe owe $21 trillion in the very near future. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re really in trouble. We have to rebuild our country. We have to rebuild our infrastructure. We have to rebuild our military.\\nAnd yet, we do deals with China where there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a trade imbalance of over $400 billion a year in their favor, by the way, in case you had any question.\\nJapan \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they send their cars by the millions. $70 billion a year imbalance. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like a loss.\\nYou look at Mexico. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to build a wall. It will be a real wall. It will be a real wall. Gonna happen. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gonna happen.\\nThe people I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m dealing with \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and you know, I really focus on Hillary later because I have to get through these 15 people. You know, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 15 of us.\\nI had Perry came at me strong; he went down. I had Gov. Walker, nice guy, he went down. Every guy that attacks me so far they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve all gone down. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to keep it that way, right?\\nI mean, Lindsey Graham. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s at zero. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s at zero. Zero.\\nLet me ask you a question. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get Lindsey Graham. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get him\\xe2\\x80\\xa6He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s literally at zero. You see him. And he keeps talking. He gets so much television. I mean, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on television all the time and he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go up. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s at zero, folks.\\nHis ideas are so bad. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m more militaristic than him. But I know how to win; he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. He just wants to attack everything. He doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know where the hell \\xe2\\x80\\x93 ra ha.\\nAnd he always sits with John McCain. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the Bobbsey twins. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re always sitting together. No, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. Do you ever notice? Sometimes I want to see him by himself. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always sitting with John McCain, who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fine. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not knocking it. But you got to know what to do.\\nNow me, I was against the war in Iraq. So everyone says, you have the right temperament \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I have a great temperament. But you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to attack. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to do something, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to know what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing.\\nI said if you attack Iraq and you wipe it out, Iran is going to take over the entire Middle East because you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to ruin the balance. It was so simple to me.\\nAnd actually they sent a group from the White House to see me because I got so much publicity, so much publicity that they sent a group from the White House to see Mr. Trump. I said, \"Fellas, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have Iran take over the Middle East and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening.\"\\nAnd Iran\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to take over Iraq as sure as you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sitting there.\\nAnd by the way, Iraq, with the second largest oil reserves anywhere in the world. We lost of thousands of lives. We have wounded warriors all over the place. $2 trillion. We have nothing. We got nothing. We have absolutely nothing. And we left.\\nAnd we have a president \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have been there but then we shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have left the way we left.\\nYou know, the funny thing is I look at Democrats and liberals and conservatives and Republicans \\xe2\\x80\\x93 wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it be good all of us if we can get together and really make our country great again? Is that what we want to do?\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll bet you that if I spoke to that young woman, that quickly I really think I can convince her that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all in this together, folks. We want to have a strong country. Right?\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6But you know, if you think about it and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have some that can never be satisfied no matter what. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re just troublemakers, et cetera, et cetera. But most people aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t and they believe something. And I have some very smart friends don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t agree with me; they agree with the other side.\\nBut I really believe that if you took it about making America great, we have to be strong, we have to be vigilant, and if we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not vigilant \\xe2\\x80\\x93 [interrupted by protester] \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that was the same person. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to tell you, so far, the security is not doing a great job in here, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you that. That was the same person. You can do very nice but why don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you get her out because honestly it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inappropriate. So security, strengthen yourself up.\\nSee, our country has this kind of security. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the problem we have\\xe2\\x80\\xa6Treat her very nicely please but she should now be taken out. Same person. One person. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one person. They let her out. They gave her a second chance and the same thing happens.\\nBut you would think that everybody we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all on the same basket that everybody every single person \\xe2\\x80\\x93 [interrupted by protester]\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6So you would think that if we could get together, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d all be in the same boat.\\nNow, last night we all saw and we witnessed something that I thought was highly inappropriate.\\nIn fact, I tweeted \"Is that all there is?\" about the president\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speech and I wrote something today that I think is very, very salient, very important, and probably not politically correct but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care.\\nYou know, we had a situation in California very recently where somebody was making bombs in an apartment. The mother saw them. The mother didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t notice anything wrong. I watched the sister being interviewed. Believe me, in my opinion, she was lying like crazy. I watched that interview. \"Oh, my brother was such a wonderful guy. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know, I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know.\"\\nAnd I watched the next door neighbor saying, \"Oh, well we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t report them because we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to racially profile or we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to profile.\" Give me a break. Give me a break.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re like the stupid country in so many different ways. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so \\xe2\\x80\\x93 can you imagine what our great leaders of the past would have said with the kind of crap that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening with us?\\nThey didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to report them because they thought it was profiling.\\nOkay, they saw bombs. They saw, you know, the pipe bombs only this wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t to build a bathroom. When a bomb is this long, can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t put too many of them together for a bathroom, right? And we thought they maybe but we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to racially profile. Oh, okay, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re okay, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re innocent.\\nOr how about where the families and the girlfriends and the wives and everything and they go back to World Trade Center \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the worst, worse than Pearl Harbor because with the World Trade Center they were killing innocent civilians. At least while it was a dirty, rotten sneak attack, at least they were\\xe2\\x80\\xa6but while it was an attack, at least it was military. But this was an attack on the World Trade Center.\\nSo, what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happened is we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re out of control. We have no idea who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming into our country. We have no idea if they love us or if they hate us. We have no idea if they want to bomb us. We have no idea what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on.\\nAnd then I looked at poll numbers and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean polls where I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m winning; those numbers I like looking at. These numbers I hated to look at. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very, very sad.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go after some of the numbers. 25% of those polled and this was from the Center for Security Policy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 very highly respected group of people who I know actually.\\nThis is people living in this country. 25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans is justified as Muslims. 25%.\\n51% of the Muslims living in this country \\xe2\\x80\\x93 by the way, I have friends that are Muslims; they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re great people. But they know we have a problem. They know we have a real problem. Because something\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on, and we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t put up with it, folks. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t put up with it.\\n51% \\xe2\\x80\\x93 51% highly respected number of polling groups want to be governed according to Sharia. You know what Sharia is.\\nSo I wrote this out. The mainstream media wants to surrender the Constitution. The mainstream media \\xe2\\x80\\x93 these people back here. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the worst. They are so dishonest. No, no, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re so dishonest. They are so dishonest.\\nI mean, I have one from NBC, a reporter from NBC, and actually another one from CBS, they actually in Columbus, Ohio, I had a tremendous crowd like 10,000 people. It was a love fest. It went on for a long time. Everybody stayed right \\xe2\\x80\\x99tis the end. I had one of the politicians \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Kasich \\xe2\\x80\\x93 who is just getting \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a horrible debater\\xe2\\x80\\xa6He made a statement that \"Oh, they left after 10 minutes.\" Now, the press was there. They saw it. Nobody said it was a lie. It was a total lie. In fact, I had more people at the end than I had at the beginning. Nobody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leaving. Nobody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leaving here except for the one person that was screaming.\\nSo, we asked the press to report that it was a total lie and they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to do that because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not their thing to do.\\nYou know, we get the biggest crowds. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to show this crowd tonight. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to show all the people outside trying to get in. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that. They have the cameras right in my face. I say fan the crowd just to show \\xe2\\x80\\x93 look at all the people over here. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a record in the history of this ship. But they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t show it. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t show it. No, no. And I say fan it and they never ever fan it. I say fan the crowd and they never fan it. And yet, I guarantee you that that young woman that just got taken out after interrupting us three times, I guarantee the cameras will be on her. I guarantee. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disgusting. Disgusting.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6And by the way, some of the media\\xe2\\x80\\x99s terrific but most of it 70%, 75% is absolute dishonest, absolute scum. Remember that. Scum. Scum. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re totally dishonest people.\\nI had one the other day where I finished the speech and they said \"Oh, Trump was interrupted and he left early.\" I spoke for like 45, 50 minutes. I then answered questions and then I went around, you know, everybody knew it was false.\\nAmazingly, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a media group that calls the media and the next day they did the most beautiful story about what a lie it was from NBC. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s back there. Little Katie. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s back there. What a lie it was. No, what a lie \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Katie Tur \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what a lie it was from NBC to have written that. It was a total lie. And they did a story where they \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know they had a group like this where they actually criticized the media. And they said it was a total lie. And I loved it. I loved it. I loved it.\\nAnd then other people pick it up. You know it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s NBC so somebody picks it up. Third rate reporter. Remember that. Third rate. Third rate.\\nSo I said here the mainstream media wants to surrender our Constitution and our constitutional rights. And I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want that. I want ISIS to surrender. Okay? I want ISIS to surrender. Very simple.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very simple. So here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what happened. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been a little controversial. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been a great day because the poll numbers are through the roof. I like that.\\nBut I have more\\xe2\\x80\\xa6I wish we could call \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is there any way we could call the election tomorrow? Wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you love that?\\nNow they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re coming at us in full force. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re coming \\xe2\\x80\\x93 not coming at me. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re coming at all of us. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re coming at all of us. Because you know, we have a noisy majority. They used to call it the quiet majority. People are fed up. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re fed up with incompetence. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re fed up with stupid leaders. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re fed up with stupid people.\\nThey are fed up with stupid people, where our president makes a deal for Sergeant Bergdahl, a dirty, rotten, no good traitor who \\xe2\\x80\\x93 think of it. They knew he was a traitor because a general and a colonel went to see his group. Six people were killed looking for him. Okay? Six people were killed. Young. Unbelievable. I watched the parents on television. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen the parents. But I watched the parents on television devastated, will never be the same. They left to try to bring them back. He left. He deserted.\\nYou know, in the old days when we were strong country it would be boom, gone. It was called desertion. Now I heard the other day they won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even do anything to him. Can you believe it? They think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to get away with nothing. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to have nothing.\\nSo he left. Oh, they treated him pretty rough though. He got in there, he said, \"I shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have done this. This isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t working out the way I thought.\"\\nAnyways, so we get him back and here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the deal we made. We get a dirty, no good traitor. Six people killed\\xe2\\x80\\xa6They get five of their greatest killers that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been after \\xe2\\x80\\x93 after \\xe2\\x80\\x93 think of it for six years. In fact, I hear nine years.\\nSo they get these \\xe2\\x80\\x93 right now have gone \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re out in the battlefield, trying to kill everybody in front of them including you folks, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d hate to tell you.\\nSo we get Bergdahl and they get five of the killers that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve wanted for many years. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way we do it.\\nThe Iran deal. We gave them $150 billion. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called amateur night. We gave them $150 billion. 24 days \\xe2\\x80\\x93 24 days \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we think there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something wrong, 24 days we have to wait but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s much longer than that because there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a whole process before the clock starts ticking. So it could be forever.\\nBut the best is where they have the right to self-inspect. \"Are you doing nuclear weapons over there?\" \"Oh, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll inspect tomorrow.\" \"Oh no, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not doing nuclear weapons.\"\\nYou know, the Persians are great negotiators. Always have been. And somebody would say that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s profiling. Trust me, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re great negotiators.\\nAnd Kerry is a horrible negotiator and Obama is a horrible negotiator. Horrible. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a horrible negotiator. These people are horrible.\\nI always Obama would be a unifier. I never thought of him as being like a divider because I said \"You know what? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be a good president.\"\\nI backed McCain; he lost by the way. And you know, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t blame McCain for losing because a lot of bad things will happen; it was a tough one. But I backed McCain; he lost. I backed Romney; he should have won but he sort of went away on vacation or something the last month and he lost. And I said, \"This time I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do it myself. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to lose.\" We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to lose. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not losing.\\nAnd the recent Fox poll that just came out has me beating Hillary very easily one on one. I love that. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so important.\\nSo, we put out a statement today. We watched this. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impossible to watch this gross incompetence but I watched last night.\\nAnd we put out a statement a little while ago and these people are going crazy\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\nShall I read you the statement?\\nDonald J. Trump is calling for \\xe2\\x80\\x93 now, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to listen to this because this is pretty heavy stuff and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s common sense and we have to do it. Remember the poll numbers. 25%, 51%. Remember the poll numbers. So remember this. So listen.\\nDonald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.\\nWe have no choice. We have no choice. We have no choice.\\nAccording to Pew Research, among others, there is a great hatred toward Americans by large segments of the Muslim population.\\nMost recently, a poll from Center for Security Policy released data showing 25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans \\xe2\\x80\\x93 these are people that are here by the way, people that are here \\xe2\\x80\\x93 25% not 1%. By the way, 1% would be unacceptable. 1% is unacceptable. 25% of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as part \\xe2\\x80\\x93 think of that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as part of the global jihad.\\nThey want to change your religion. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think so. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think so. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think so. Not going to happen.\\nAs part of the global jihad. And 51% of those polled agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Sharia. You know what Sharia is. 51%.\\nSharia authorizes \\xe2\\x80\\x93 now look, this is, I mean, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s terrible. Sharia authorizes such atrocities as murders against non-believers who won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t convert, beheadings, and more unthinkable acts that pose great harm to Americans especially women. I mean, you look \\xe2\\x80\\x93 especially women. Tough stuff.\\nAnd we have a president that won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even mention the term and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about numbers like this.\\nMr. Trump stated without looking at the various polling data, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\nWhere the hatred comes from and why, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to determine. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to figure it out. We have to figure it out. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t live like this. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to get worse and worse. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have more World Trade Centers. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to get worse and worse folks.\\nWe could be politically correct and we can be stupid but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to get worse and worse.\\nUntil we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victim of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad.\\nThese are people only believe in jihad. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want our system. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want our system and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. They have no respect for human life.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6So prior to Paris, which was a disaster, which by the way if some of the people in those places where it was slaughter, absolute slaughter, had guns, you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have had the carnage that you had in Paris. You wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t had that carnage. If they had guns, you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t had that carnage.\\nSo important the Second Amendment. We have to preserve it and cherish it. And we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let these weak leaders diminish it.\\nIf they had guns in Paris, if five people in that room, Paris and France has probably the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world and it was like target practice. \"Come over here. Boom! Come over here. Boom!\" People are sitting by the hundreds and many others are going to be dying. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sitting in the hospital in many cases waiting to die.\\nNow, the same thing a few days ago in California. No guns. We didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have guns. The bad guys had the guns.\\nAnd these young people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I tell the press you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to stop calling them \"masterminds\" \\xe2\\x80\\x93 these are dirty, rotten scums. These aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t masterminds.\\nRemember the guy in Paris with the big dirty hat? Remember the guy in Paris \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the \"mastermind\". I was watching all the networks. I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mention who but some of them disgusted me. \"The mastermind is on the loose.\"\\nAnd we have kids that are watching the Internet and they want to be masterminds and then you wonder why do we lose all these kids \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they go over there. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re young. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re impressionable. They go over there and they want to join ISIS.\\nAnd we have our anchors \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I think I got them mostly stopped. Did you notice that? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hear it too much. But they say \"the young mastermind\". Oh, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brilliant. Young man, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brilliant.\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got a high IQ\\xe2\\x80\\xa6In Paris, I call him the guy with the dirty filthy hat. Okay? Not a smart guy. A dummy. Puts people in there \\xe2\\x80\\x93 mastermind \\xe2\\x80\\x93 bing, bing, bing, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like shooting everybody. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to be a mastermind.\\nSo the press has to be responsible. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not being responsible because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re losing a lot of people because of the Internet.\\nAnd we have to do something. We have to go see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening. We have to talk to them. Maybe in certain areas closing that Internet up in some way.\\nSomebody will \"Oh, freedom of speech, freedom of speech\". These are foolish people. We have a lot of foolish people. We have a lot of foolish people.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to maybe do something with the Internet because they are recruiting by the thousands. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leaving our country. And then when they come back, we take them back. \"Oh, come on back. Where were you?\" \"I was fighting for ISIS.\" \"Oh, come on back. Go home. Enjoy yourself.\"\\nWhen they leave our country and they go to fight for ISIS or any of the other groups, they never come back. They never can come back. They never can come back. They can never, ever, ever come back. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s over.\\nHow about that? And now that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve become radicalized, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re totally radicalized.\\nAnd how about the woman? She was in Pakistan then Saudi Arabia. She comes in on an engagement deal and she radicalized the guy. Probably a guy who couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get women. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what the hell his problem is. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably the first women he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ever had. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what was going on. But he became radicalized quickly. Notice how easy it is? He becomes radicalized and then they go on a spree.\\nFolks, those days are over. Those days are over. We have to be tough. We have to be smart. We have to be vigilant.\\nYes, we have to look at mosques and we have to respect mosques. But yes, we have to look at mosques. We have no choice. We have to see what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening because something is happening in there. Man, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anger. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anger. And we have to know about it. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be these people that are sitting back like in the World Trade Center, like so many different things.\\nWe can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be people that knew what was going on two weeks ago in California, probably for months they knew what was going on and they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to tell anybody. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be that.\\nWe have to be strong. When we see violations, you have to report those violations and quickly. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry about profiling. I promise I will defend you from profiling. I promise.\\nSo when I started this whole quest \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I mean, who knew it was going to turn into this? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been an amazing thing. No matter where I go, I have tremendous crowds, packed crowds, packed.\\nWe went to Dallas \\xe2\\x80\\x93 20,000 people in Dallas. 25,000 people. Mobile, Alabama \\xe2\\x80\\x93 35,000 people. Here, every time I come to South Carolina, every time I go to North Carolina, every time I go to Iowa, New Hampshire, Virginia, wherever I go \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Florida \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we have crowds that are maxed. The only problem we have is the size of the room \\xe2\\x80\\x93 thousands of people outside trying to get in. Usually I do a double. I go talk to them for a while, which I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say I exactly love doing after the first one.\\nBut there is an unbelievable love in these rooms \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all the same. I love you too. I love you\\xe2\\x80\\xa6Thank you. Thank you. I love you too.\\nThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an unbelievable love in all of these places \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Oklahoma \\xe2\\x80\\x93 20,000 people standing in a park on quick notice. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an unbelievable love. And there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an unbelievable love of the country. We want to see good things. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to be bad people. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to be tough and nasty. We believe in the Constitution more than anybody.\\nBut we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let people use and abuse our rights. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let people kill us. They want to kill us. They want to destroy us. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let it happen. We just can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let it happen.\\nAnd I have a friend who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very, very successful man, and I went to one event \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he came with me. We had 24,000 people. And this guy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a real tough cookie. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great financial guy. One of the guys I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d definitely use to negotiate with Japan, China. Believe me, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be in good shape when that happens. We won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have these characters.\\nYou know, this whole thing with all of these guys. By the way, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the only one that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s self-funding my campaign. Everyone else is controlled. Only one. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the only one. Only one.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m self-funding my campaign. And these other guys. You know, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting millions and millions of dollars from people I know.\\nI have one guy came and wanted to give me a lot of money. I said, \"Honestly, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take it. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to do.\" I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take it, which is very sort of like for me to not take money \\xe2\\x80\\x93 my whole life I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been taking money. Now I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sort of like what am I doing? But came in and I said, \"So what are you going to do? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want your money.\" And he said, \"I got to go someplace else.\" They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re like gamblers. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re like gamblers. But I said, \"You like me best.\" \"I like you best but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to go someplace else.\" Because they want to be part \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they want to \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6Let me tell you, who is more than me? I gave millions to these guys. Nobody knows the system better than me. I knew it from the other side. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget, I was the fair-haired boy. I was like the establishment. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99d all come to me, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d give them all money I write checks sometimes to Senators whatever the max \\xe2\\x80\\x93 bing, bing, bing.\\nI used to say \"Senators, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come to my office. Anybody that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a U.S. Senator that calls me, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll send you a campaign contribution.\"\\nBut you know what? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you something. In the end, the people that gives these millions of dollars to these horrible, corrupt PACS \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re corrupt \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they totally control Bush and Rubio and I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say Cruz because he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been very nice to me. Nah, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been nice. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to hit me first. Once he hits me, I promise you. I promise you.\\nNo, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been nice to Christie but he really hit me today. Chris Christie. I mean, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a friend of mine but he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not doing well in the polls and he really, really hit me today. He hated this and yet he said anybody could come. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to look at some of the statements from the past. But he really hit me on the whole thing that we have to stop the Muslims until we find out what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on.\\nDoes that make sense by the way? Until we find out.\\nAnd he talked about \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inexperience and you know in other words he has experience right?\\nBut that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the statement of an inexperienced man\\xe2\\x80\\xa6About we have to stop people that want to kill us from coming in. Does that sound like inexperienced?\\nSo Chris, who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a friend of mine, he hit me hard. And I said I got to hit him at least once. So I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do this a lot.\\nLook, here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the story. The George Washington Bridge. He knew about it.\\nHey, how do you have breakfast with people everyday of your lives, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re closing up the largest bridge in the world, the biggest in the United States, traffic flowing during rush hour. People couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get across for 6, 7 hours. Ambulances, fire trucks. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re with him all the time \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the people that did it.\\nThey never said, \"Hey boss, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re closing up the George Washington Bridge tonight.\" No, they never said that. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about the weather, right?\\nHe knew about it. He knew about it. Totally knew about it. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a got a very friendly group of people over there that they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think so. But I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called life. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to be smart in life.\\nI would say there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s less than 1% chance. It could be but I doubt it. He knew about it. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mention at one of their meetings? I think they had breakfast like everyday or every other day. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99d just say, \"Chris, tonight we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re closing up the George Washington Bridge because the mayor a certain area is against you.\" \"Oh, okay.\" They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mention? Nobody believes that.\\nNumber two. Nine downgrades of the state. Nine downgrades. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a disaster. I have property over there \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the taxes are through \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll use an expression \\xe2\\x80\\x93 coming out of my ears, okay? Tremendous taxes over there. You had nine downgrades.\\nYou had Christie, you know, so friendly with President Obama during the flood.\\nI actually called. I said, \"Let me ask you. Is he going to vote for Obama?\" I thought he was going to vote for Obama. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. I think he possibly did.\\nAnd Romney I was very disappointed. One of the reasons I was disappointed was he called Christie and had dinner right after the election. If Christie did that to me, I would have never spoken to him again. I would have never done it.\\nSo when Chris talks about \\xe2\\x80\\x93 when he talks about lack of experience \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I built this incredible company. I filed papers where everyone said \"Wow, that is unbelievable.\" I would have probably filed them even when I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t run because I built a great, great company. Tremendous cash. Tremendous assets. Tremendous net worth. Very little debt. Unbelievable cash flow. And I filed.\\nEverybody said \"Number one, he won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t run.\" And I ran. I took a deep breath and I said, \"Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go\" to my wife and we came down that escalator. Right, the famous escalators. Hopefully in many years that will be a very famous scene because we will have turned around our country and that will be a positive note, okay?\\nBut then they said, \"Oh, well he announced.\" So these talking heads \\xe2\\x80\\x93 most of whom are not even smart people, believe me. Then they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d say well, they went to Ivy League college. So did I go to Ivy League college. They went to this. Most of them didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go to Ivy League colleges by the way but they say they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re brilliant. One\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brilliant because he wears glasses, you know? Like Perry. Remember Perry? We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like him.\\nBut what happens is they say \"Well, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never file form A.\" That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s basically where you sign your life away. I filed form A.\\nThen they said, \"Well, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never sign his financial statement because maybe he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not as rich as everybody thinks.\" Then they said, \"And if he does, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll ask for many, many delays because you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re entitled to 45 day delays, delays, and you can delay it until forever. And they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll delay it until after the election.\"\\nI said, \"No\" so I filed it ahead of schedule. And what happened? Remember? They went down. They couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it. It was much, much, much better than anybody ever envisioned.\\nI built a great company and the reason \\xe2\\x80\\x93 honestly worth billions and billions of dollars. Remember that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 low debt, great cash flow, and the greatest assets \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Doral, Trump Tower, the Trump Building, big chunk of the Bank of America building in San Francisco, 1290 Ave., land all over, land on the Potomac, land all over.\\nIn North Carolina, I have a great piece of property. Trump National Golf Club. Some of you know it. Great, right at the best location.\\nAnd what happens? What happens? So I filed and everyone said \"Oh, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it.\"\\nThen they said \"Well, maybe he won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do so well with the polls.\" And you know, before I went, people never believed I was going to run. They never thought I was going to run.\\nAnd I told the story the other night for really the first real time. But my wife said to me \"You know if you run you will win. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you?\" She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very smart.\\nI said, \"What do you mean?\" She said, \"If you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t run, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re never going to poll before. Nobody believes you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to run.\" So if they do polls like they did these early polls, they weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t great before I announced. She said, \"No, the only way you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get a poll number is you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to announce.\" Nobody believes even though they say, even though they say you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re running, it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter. Nobody believes you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re running.\\nSo I said, \"All right.\" I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m getting these lousy early numbers and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m saying, \"I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to run and find out it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work.\" I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to be embarrassed like Lindsey Graham and all these guys who have nothing. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true.\\nSo I said, \"All right. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s take it.\"\\nSo we go down on the escalator. You know what I did? You remember I took a deep breath because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m telling you and you know what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m talking about the press down there look like the Academy Awards. There were so many cameras. I have never seen anything like it. The entire atrium of Trump Tower was packed with cameras and press. And I just said, \"Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go\" to my wife.\\nI took a deep breath and I went down and I talked about lots of things, including illegal immigration.\\nAnd illegal immigration was such a big subject. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m telling you had I not brought it up, it has turned out to be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I took heat. I took heat like nobody has ever taken heat. Rush Limbaugh said \"The most incredible incoming that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen a human being endure\". And then he doubled down a week later because I was right.\\nAnd now, illegal immigration is one of the biggest things.\\nAnd then you had the killing of Kate [Steinle] and the killing of Jamiel and the killing recently in California of a 66-year-old \\xe2\\x80\\x93 think of it, 66-year-old \\xe2\\x80\\x93 veteran, female, raped, sodomized and killed by an illegal immigrant. And many, many more. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a huge problem.\\nAnd they take our jobs and a lot of other things.\\nSo all of a sudden, everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s saying \"Wow\"\\xe2\\x80\\xa6and from almost at the beginning, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been at the top like from almost day one.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6The reason I tell you certain things and the reason I talk about what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done and lots of good things. A little thing \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Wollman ice skating rink. The city couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get it built for high years. They were in there for like $20 million. They couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get it done. I went to the mayor of New York, I said, \"Ed Koch, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get it done real quick.\" He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like it because he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to be shown up. I said I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do it and if it costs more than $2 million I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll pay for it. I got it built for peanuts. Got it done in four months. And we had ice skating in Central Park and I still run it.\\nI did another one \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I did a bigger version of that recently Ferry Point out in the Bronx. They were having \\xe2\\x80\\x93 things have been under construction from anywhere between 20 and 30 years. They couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get it done. I got it done under a year. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operating now. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very successful.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I do and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we need. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what we need in our country.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m building on Pennsylvania Avenue an incredible hotel. One of the great hotels of the world. The Old Post Office site. Think of it. I got it in the Obama administration. Everybody was bidding. Everybody wanted it. One of the most sought after projects in the history of the GSA \\xe2\\x80\\x93 general services. And I got it. Can you imagine me getting it from the Obama administration? Because the GSA, who are really professionals, they want to make sure number one that it got built. So they wanted strong financials. And they also wanted a great plan. So we came up with Ivanka and my kids we came up with this incredible plan. The job is under budget, ahead of schedule. It was going to open up in \\xe2\\x80\\x9917 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 sometime during the year \\xe2\\x80\\x9917. Now, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to open probably in September of \\xe2\\x80\\x9916 right before the election on Pennsylvania Avenue.\\nAnd this is the kind of mindset you need.\\nCarl Icahn, one of the great businessmen, and others have endorsed me.\\nWe have trillions and trillions of dollars offshore. Pfizer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leaving the United States.\\nIn the old days, somebody would leave for, frankly, South Carolina. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99d leave New York or Florida or someplace where the taxes are lower. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99d leave for North Carolina. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99d leave \\xe2\\x80\\x93 today they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d leave this country for other countries.\\nSo now, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re losing Pfizer. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re losing many of our great companies.\\nWe have $2.5 trillion offshore at least. And everybody agrees it should come home \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the Democrats, the Republicans. For three years, they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make a deal. They can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make a deal because there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s such gridlock. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no leadership in Washington.\\nWe will make this country so great. We have people and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you something. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you something\\xe2\\x80\\xa6[interrupted by protester] said something to me the other day and what I really want to do \\xe2\\x80\\x93 [interrupted by protester] \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what we want to do or what I want to do is I want to be the people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s president.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6Think of this, think of this, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work for any of the lobbyists. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work for any of these people that are leading our country in the wrong direction. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6The best thing that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen in going around and the thing that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen more than anything else is how smart the people are. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe those people in the back that write with fork. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m telling you, they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe them. The people are really smart.\\nWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s giving me more inspiration than any other single thing are the people that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve met \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the incredible people of this country.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make America great again. And you know what? We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make it greater, greater, than ever before. And I love you all and thank you very much. South Carolina. Great. Thank you! We love you. Thank you!\\nThank you very much, everybody. You just like me because my daughter happens to be Jewish. Right? She has a great husband, Jared, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what Ivanka could not be happier and she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very proud. The only bad news, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get her on Saturday. I call and I call. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t speak to my daughter anymore on Saturdays. But that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s okay.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an honor to be with you. You know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve devoted so much time over my life to Israel, and the other politicians they can talk but believe me they haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t done what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve received many, many awards.\\nI was the Grand Marshal of the Israeli Day Parade at a very dangerous time when people said, \"Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it.\" I walked up Fifth Avenue. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking up for lots of trouble. But I said, \"No way am I not going to do it.\" And it was a rough time as you know. It was 2004, and it was a tremendously successful parade. Maybe their most successful parade that they ever had.\\nSo, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in a different position than the other candidates because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the one candidate I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want any of your money; I want your support but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want your money.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m self-funding my campaign. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been an amazing experience for me because I have very little money invested so far.\\nI thought by this time I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have about 30 million in ads and I have none although I took a small radio commercial the other day in Iowa. But we have virtually no money in invested in ads or advertising. And I think you as business people will feel pretty good about this and respect it.\\nAt first, I was embarassed by that. I said, \"You know, I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have spend money just to spend money\" but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not really like a good thing to do because I am in first place by a lot. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not even close. Every single poll, every single state.\\nThe numbers just came in three minutes ago in New Hampshire \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the PPP poll \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Trump at 27%, the next one is 13%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 5%, and the rest are off the board. They have to drop out pretty soon I guess, right?\\nMost of importantly, favorability \\xe2\\x80\\x93 no, I still like the top number the most but favorability is now at 50% to 39%, which is good, and I beat Hillary in the Fox poll as you see very easily 46% to 41%. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ultimately the most important.\\nAnd you know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been a tremendous fan and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been a tremendous contributor. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve given a lot of money recently to Hatzalah, $100,000, emergency response. They do a fantastic job.\\nAnd my father, Fred, was always a big supporter. So I grew up in that environment. I grew up in Brooklyn, Queens, and Israel was always very paramount in our mind.\\nIn fact, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been sometimes criticized because I received so many awards from Jewish groups, and they look at my wall. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loaded up. But now the Christians are catching up, I have to tell you.\\nMy Christians are liking me a lot lately and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been great. They have been great.\\nSo, Obama is the worst thing that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ever happened to Israel. The worst. The worst.\\nAnd when I see great friends of mine who are very, very pro-Israel, very \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I mean, they love Israel. They love it with passion, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re having fundraisers for Obama. I said, \"What are you doing?\"\\nAnd it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s almost like they answer me and they say, \"We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. He comes to New York. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know.\" I said he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a disaster.\\nI really believe the Iran deal. Look, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a negotiator like you folks. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re negotiators.\\nWe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t build gas stations in the middle of, as you know, Afghanistan for $43 million \\xe2\\x80\\x93 can you imagine this? A small gas station \\xe2\\x80\\x93 $43 million \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and then they used the wrong kind of terminal because they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sell that type of gas. Okay? $43 million for a gas station.\\nHow many think they could have done it for less? Would you raise your hands please?\\nBut I look at Obama, I look at that deal where we gave to Iran $150 billion. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need to develop nuclear weapons; they can buy them. They can buy them. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. Why do they have to develop them? They can buy them. We gave them $150 billion.\\nThey go out and in terms of, you know, surveillance, they have the right to self-inspect. How about that? On their major, most dangerous they can self-inspect.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to let them self-inspect. And then you have of course the 24 days and the 24 days we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all good with contracts don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t start until such and such happens. It could be forever before you ever go into inspect.\\nAnd we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even get our prisoners back.\\nAnd now they want to start a negotiation to get the prisoners back and they want 19 people for our three. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to give us our four. You know we have four. But they only want to talk three.\\nNow, that should have been negotiated right at the beginning, three years ago.\\nAnd maybe better than any audience, I mean, the people in this room understand what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m saying. It should have been you walk in \\xe2\\x80\\x93 by the way, did you ever see a negotiation take so long? And we conceded on every single. We didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win anything. We didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win anything.\\nBut that should have been with our prisoners \\xe2\\x80\\x93 day one, whatever it is years ago, we have to get our prisoners back. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want them. We need them. It will make us look better. Both everybody is going to like us more. With the American public, any deal that we strike, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to look good.\\nAnd you say that. We have to get our prisoners back. Day one. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to say, \"No, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not giving.\" And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to say, \"Bye bye. Bye! Call us when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re ready.\" And then we go out and double up and triple up the sanctions. I guarantee you within 48 hours they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re calling, begging us to come back to the table and you have your prisoners back. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so easy.\\nNow, the president, you saw that, and John Kerry, who is probably the worst negotiator I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen. No, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the worst negotiator I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen. He did not read The Art of the Deal, folks, I can tell you that. Now, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the few. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 biggest selling of all time business book of all time, he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t read it. And Obama definitely didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t read it. Obama, ayeyeye. Oh.\\nBut they said \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this is hard to believe but this is what they said \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a lot of press back there so I have to say everything exactly correct because if I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t I end up with a \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they said we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to complicate the negotiations by asking for the prisoners. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really complicated. We want our prisoners back. Oh, so complicated. They said they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to complicate \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so now, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to end up making a new deal probably at some point.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d tell you this, look I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll just tell you this: If I win, before I take office, I guarantee you those prisoners are going to be back. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be back, I guarantee you. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be back.\\nNow, our president doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to use the term \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we had another event, which probably was \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the one yesterday \\xe2\\x80\\x93 probably was related. It always happens but it probably was. When I heard about it, I figured maybe not. But it turns out probably was related \\xe2\\x80\\x93 radical Islamic terrorism. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what, we have a president that refuses to use the term. He refuses to say. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something going on with him that we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know about.\\nNow, as far as Hillary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s concerned, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to go with what he wants.\\nShe shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be allowed to run. What she did is criminal with the emails. She shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be allowed to run.\\nShe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to have to follow his line because she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on a thread. You know, look, in real life, his Attorney General, his U.S. Attorney, his Attorney General. So his Attorney General is going to listen to him in my opinion. I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very dishonest what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on with our government.\\nGen. [David] Petraeus was given a life-changing sentence. Other people have been sent to jail. Petraeus was, you know, essentially \\xe2\\x80\\x93 look, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to get into it with the poor guy. What he went \\xe2\\x80\\x93 for nothing, compared to what she did for nothing, for 5% of what she did.\\nAnd Obama, I mean, she can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go against him because only does boom she gets indicted. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the end of it. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the end of it.\\nSo when you see Hillary backing up virtually everything he says, and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got control of her. I mean, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just total control.\\nBut I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what, she shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be allowed to run. What she did was a criminal act.\\nAnd remember this, this is a six-year \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you have a six year statute of limitations. So she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fighting for her life. If she doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t become president, she could have a real problem. Does that make any sense to anybody? Does that make sense to anybody?\\nBecause what she did was just wrong. Okay? And you know she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been involved in corruption her whole life, whether it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Whitewater. I mean, her whole life is corruption.\\nShe was a horrible Secretary of State. She did a horrible job other than traveled a lot. She traveled a lot, nothing ever got done. The whole \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the world blew up around her. It blew up.\\n500 to 600 calls and emails and everything from our ambassador asking for help and she didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t respond.\\nThe truth is she doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the strength or the energy. She responded to her friends. You know the friends we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about. Some of those friends are, you know, sort of an interesting friend going on there.\\nBut she responded \\xe2\\x80\\x93 yeah, you get that, right? A lot of people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get that.\\nBut she responded to a friend, but she doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t respond to an ambassador that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s asking for help. Hundreds \\xe2\\x80\\x93 hundreds of requests and she doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t respond.\\nNow, remember this, I go every night to someplace. I mean, yesterday I was in Manassas, Virginia, we had an unbelievable crowd.\\nThe other day I was in Florida, we had 12,000 people in Sarasota at 12 p.m. with the football games going on. 12,000 people. The convention center held 5,000. So we had thousands outside. I made a speech outside. I made two speeches\\xe2\\x80\\xa6I said, \"You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get me a larger convention center so I can do one speech?\" My people said, \"No, this is the biggest one. We set a record \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a big record. We set a record everywhere. We beat the record of Elton John. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. Elton John. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m no longer competing with politicians. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m competing with the musical talent.\\nOne of the great musicians said \"You get the largest crowds of any single human being on Earth without a guitar\" meaning who doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t count on music.\\nSo it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had tremendous response. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had incredible response.\\nI think you know if you look at what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on and I think based on the response, based on the polls \\xe2\\x80\\x93 again I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want your money therefore you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re probably not going to support me because stupidly you want to give money. Trump doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want money therefore we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \\xe2\\x80\\x93 even though he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s better than all these guys, even though he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to do more for Israel than anybody else, even though Bibi Netanyahu asked me to do a commercial for him and I did and he won his race, so I was very happy about that. But he asked me to do a commercial. And they said I was the only celebrity. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but they said I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the only celebrity. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not a celebrity. See now I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a politician. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m so embarrassed by that term.\\nYou know, my how life I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been a business, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been a developer. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. I have unbelievable statements and unbelievable company.\\nA lot of people said, \"Oh, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never file.\" This you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get a kick out of. \"He\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never run because he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never want to file various papers. And then he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never file this and that and then you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have to sign your life away.\" The first paper \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we all know about first papers. You sign your life away. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the end of it. He did it.\\nThen they said, \"Well, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never sign and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never file his financials because who knows, maybe he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not as rich as people think.\"\\nSo I filed my financials \\xe2\\x80\\x93 almost 100 pages. The biggest ever filed by the federal elections. And everybody said, \"Oh my, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s much bigger and much stronger and holy mackeral, look at these numbers!\"\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6If I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t run, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d probably would have filed anyways because you know I built a great company and I like to brag about it whenever possible. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true.\\nSome of the greatest assets \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Doral, you know, Doral and Turnberry in Scotland and Trump Tower and many buildings in Manhattan. Just many \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Bank of America building in San Francisco with a great partner and so many other buildings and things\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\nAnd the reason I bring that up is because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the kind of thinking we need.\\nAnd I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bring it up as braggadocio. I bring it up because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the kind of thinking we need in this country to bring us back. We have people that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know the first thing about the word negotiation.\\nI can take anybody in this office, believe me, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re better than Obama and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re better than Kerry and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re better than the foolish people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the foolish people. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so embarrassing when you see what happens.\\nSergeant Bergdahl, all right? Sergeant Bergdahl \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we get a traitor; they get five of the greatest killers that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve wanted for nine years. You know, the deal was five for one.\\nAnd they knew he was a traitor before we made the deal. You know about Sergeant Bergdahl. He deserted. Six people were killed trying to get him back. They were looking for him.\\nThe general and the colonel went to see all those people, they said, \"No, he deserted. He was a traitor.\" And we still made the deal.\\nSo we get a traitor. We can give him back. Do you want to re-negotiate deals? Some of us will re-negotiate deals. I would say about 99.9 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is there anybody that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t re-negotiate deals in this room? This room negotiates so I want to re-negotiate \\xe2\\x80\\x93 perhaps more than any room than I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever spoken. Maybe more. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s okay. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been called on that a couple of times too.\\nBut the fact is I want to renegotiate that deal. I want to drop him right smack in the middle of where he came from. The hell \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they can have him even if we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get the five guys back because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen because you know where they are right now? They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re right now all in the battlefield fighting us and trying to kill us and kill anybody that gets in.\\nSo they get their five guys that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve wanted for nine years they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve wanted them and we get a dirty rotten traitor. But that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way our people negotiate. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re stupid people. Okay? They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re stupid people.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very sad. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very sad.\\nSo I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll just tell you that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to win. I am. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to win. I mean, unless something happens, you know, walk across the street, the wrong thing happens. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what, I have a great secret service. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nice one, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re number one, they give you a secret service. I never saw so many people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 talented people, great people.\\nBut I believe I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to win. I really have just a great feeling about it. And you know, my life has been about winning. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve won, and my life has been about winning, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I want to do for the country.\\nAnd if people say about my company and deals and you can do this deal or that deal, I have no interest.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like the other day \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Ivanka, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s doing so great. \"Dad, we can buy this wonderful office building and I said, \"Honey, who cares? How can you talk to me about such trivial things, Ivanka?\" It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amazing. See? Now I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m dealing in trillions. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never heard of trillions before. You know, with this \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we owe $19 trillion.\\nWe just signed a budget that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so bad and the Republicans \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, we know where the Democrats are coming from. But these Republican politicians, they go to Washington and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to end Obamacare, which I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do by the way \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m ending, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m terminating, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be repealed and replaced with something much better. But they go to Washington and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do this and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do budgets \\xe2\\x80\\x93 like I heard the guy before \"We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to work in the budget.\" It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all about that. What happens is they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do budgets like we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do this and that and I tell this story \\xe2\\x80\\x93 then they walk into the Capitol Building, which is magnificent, and they look up \"Darling, oh my, look at those columns, look at the ceiling, look at the angels. Oh, look at these magnificent floors.\" They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never seen anything like it. \"We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve arrived. This is incredible.\" And then they become mainstream. \"We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll vote on Obamacare. Yes, I vote.\" They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to leave. They lose all of their courage. I want to use a nice word because otherwise they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d get reported for foul language. They lose all of their courage and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve let us down. That won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen with me.\\nSo, again, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to support me even though you know I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the best thing that could ever happen to Israel and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be that. I know why you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to support me and you know you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to support me because I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want your money. Isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it crazy? No, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true.\\nYou know, if I wanted to have your money, I think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have a damn good chance and I think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d get more money than anybody else.\\nDo you know the money I have turned down? This has not been my life turning down money. Guys want to give me millions.\\nI would have made \\xe2\\x80\\x93 poor Jeb Bush, I mean, this poor guy with his low energy. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sad. No, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sad.\\nI came up with that term, it became so defining. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like having it on his forehead \"I am low energy\". No, no, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sad.\\nHe raised $125 million, which means he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s controlled totally, totally controlled by the people that gave him the money.\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to give me money, okay? But that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s okay. You want to control your own politician. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fine. Good. Fine. Think about that, folks. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry about it.\\nI understand. Hey, five months ago, I was with you. Who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s better than me? Who is better than me? I gave $350,000 to the Republican Governors Association. I never even gotten a letter of thank you. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. $350,000. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t receive one letter, not one letter from one governor. Stupid. The good thing is I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give any \\xe2\\x80\\x93 why would I give any more? You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get a thank you letter.\\nPoliticians \\xe2\\x80\\x93 remember this \\xe2\\x80\\x93 politicians forget, politicians generally aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t competent, and the one thing they are good at is getting elected and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to end up having.\\nBut I would love your support but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want your money. I appreciate it. Now, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s take some questions. Okay? Good.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to go there right after this. I have to go through \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, you have to watch to make sure that the contractors aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stealing and ripping you off and everything else.\\nBut to show you how important this forum is and how important the country is to me and how important Israel is to me, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so important, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mention my projects. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not like very important to me anymore.\\nWhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really important to me is the United States and making it great again.\\nMy theme is Make America Great Again. I mean, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s taken off like crazy. The hats \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going crazy.\\nBut you know, some of these guys try to copy it but I had it trademarked because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re smart.\\nA couple of them got up. No, you see, I was making this speech and everybody stood up \\xe2\\x80\\x93 make America great again\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 But nobody stood up to them. But we sent them a little notice \\xe2\\x80\\x93 don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use that term. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re trademarked.\\nCan you imagine I got the approval?\\nBut we are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re building a great hotel down the road. I hope you all stay and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be wonderful\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6So I was interviewed yesterday by a whole group of reporters from AP and they did a very good job. Very fair story.\\nAnd one of the questions was about Israel and the Palestinians what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to happen.\\nI said \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I used that as an example of some deals that are maybe the hardest deal ever in history to make\\xe2\\x80\\xa6Can we think of any deals? We all have tough deals, right? You know, we have some good, some bad\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\nBut I said people are going to have to make sacrifices one way or the other.\\nI believe \\xe2\\x80\\x93 because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a dealmaker \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I believe that I can put both sides together.\\nBut I said, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take six months. At the end of six months and maybe sooner \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with us we have a deal instinct. A lot of us. And you can walk into a room and you can almost tell like in two seconds whether or not you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make a deal.\\nI will know very quickly whether or not I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be able to put that deal together.\\nI used that in this interview as an example of perhaps the hardest deal in history to put together. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably no tougher deal.\\nIf I could do that, it would make me so happy because there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so much violence, so much death, and just been going on for so many years.\\nNow, I said you have to have a commitment to make it. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that Israel has the commitment to make it, and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that the other side has the commitment to make it.\\nWith that being said, you know, I have a good chance of winning because you look at what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on. So I have a good chance. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like to as a dealmaker give away a lot of cards by talking about how I feel about this or that. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rather save it for that moment when you walk into the room. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want one side or the other saying.\\nLook, I think people know where I stand. But wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it be great if they could make a deal? But a lasting deal, a real deal. Not a phony deal that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to last a week and then bad things started happening again.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d love to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I will give it. You know Obama, as you know he said it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen, meaning he gave up on this before it even started.\\nBut I think it would be a great thing for Israel \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I think it would be a great actually for both sides if a real deal could be made, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to give it my best.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a great dealmaker. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I do. I made a lot of money. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to give it my best. It would be great if that deal could be made.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\nBy the way, Israel has given a lot\\xe2\\x80\\xa6And a lot of people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that. I think the public relations for Israel hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been so great because Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s given a lot but hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been given a lot of credit for what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve given\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\nIn fact, some things have been given which were unthinkable and a lot of turmoil it caused in Israel. There were things given. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to go in with a clean slate and just say let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go, everybody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s even, we love everybody, and let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s see if we could do something.\\nBut I do think this \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I do think right from the beginning and that one of the reasons I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m saying it now even though perhaps it comes back to haunt me later on it has to be said that Israel has given a lot. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know whether or not they want to go that far in a little step and you know that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be up to them. But Israel has not been given the credit that they deserve for what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done. I will say that. I will say that. So that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s it.\\nYou know what I want to do? I want to wait until I meet with Bibi. You know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m leaving for Israel in a very short period of time. I know. I know what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re saying. I just \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the wise guy?\\nDo me a favor. Just relax. Okay? You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll like me very much, believe me. Okay? And you wonder why you get yourself in trouble. All right? You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to like me very much. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be fine.\\nBut again, you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go in with that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make a deal and you could make a great deal \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go in with the attitude we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to shove it down. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to go in and get it and do it and do it nicely so everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happy. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry about it. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be very happy. Okay? Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry about it.\\nI think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very good man. I think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been treated very badly. I think that our president has been unbelievably rude to Bibi. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how many people like Bibi. But I think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been unbelievably rude.\\nAnd \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I mean, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll talk about deals after the fact, which is a shame but I think the Iran deal is the worst single thing.\\nPerhaps it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go down \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been pretty good at predicting things. I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to go down as the worst single thing that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ever happened to Israel. I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a catastrophe for Israel.\\nAnd I think the fact that Obama was willing to make that deal for anybody that loves Israel to support this guy or even the Democratic Party is impossible to believe.\\nI think it will be one of the great catastrophes.\\nBut if I get in, I will straighten it out, believe me. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be straightened out. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be straightened out tough and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be straightened out fast.\\nThe one bad thing is if I get in, the $150 billion is gone. That hurts me and that hurts the people of Israel. But the $150 billion is gone because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be gone before you get there.\\nYou know, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about a year and more actually. Although the election very quick. You know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming up. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s now less than a year and you know we have the Iowa starts on February 1st and then we go right down the line and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very exciting. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about a couple of months now for it to start.\\nFor a person like me, I mean, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very exciting.\\nWell, I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been working too much with the Arab leaders, to be honest with you. Okay?\\nYou know, I told you I made commercials for Bibi. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to help me in the negotiation. I can tell you. You know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m trying to keep it nice and level, right? Then I get people screaming at me. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m trying to keep it as level as possible but I for the most part don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know.\\nThe King of Jordan seems like a nice man. I mean, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to see. A lot of people like him; some people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\nBut I think I will probably be able \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what my history \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, I took some heat because I get along with Democrats, I get along with liberals, I get along with conservatives, I get along with Republicans. I get along with everybody. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I was \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a businessperson. I get along with everybody. We have to get along with everybody.\\nAnd I took some heat and I always explained that. I said, \"Wait a minute, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a businessperson. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to get along with everybody.\" I live in Manhattan. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all Democrat. I mean, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s virtually all \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Republicans don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even run people for the most part and if they do they get 5%. You know, they get a very small percentage of the vote. Got to get along with everybody.\\nI think that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be a tremendous asset because right now we have gridlock in Washington. We have people that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk.\\nYou know, I remember that years ago because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been a very political person on the other side but always very political.\\nBut years ago, the Republicans and the Democrats \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they used to like each other. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99d get along. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have dinner together. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99d argue and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d fight and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d disagree and would have, you know, different views and things.\\nBut in the evening, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d go out and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have dinner together with their families. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see that anymore.\\nThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s total hatred and there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s total gridlock.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll give you one point, which I think is important. Corporate inversions. Right? So you have companies leaving the United States and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leaving because of better taxes and better a lot of things. A lot of things are better. But they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leaving. Pfizer. How good is Pfizer? Thousands and thousands of jobs are going to be lost.\\nBut they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re also leaving because we have $2.5 trillion at least \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a much higher number than that. $2.5 trillion \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s out of the country that these companies can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get back because of bureaucracy and horrible trade agreements but because the taxes are too high. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re so onerous that nobody in this room would agree to pay that much money to get your money out.\\nSo they leave it over there and they actually take the company and they move the company to the money because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how much money.\\nThe Republicans and the Democrats totally agree that the money should come back. For three years they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get a deal. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no leadership. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gridlock.\\nThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an example of something where everybody agrees \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all the people that you see up here they all agree but they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get it done because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re politicians. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all talk; they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re no action.\\nSo there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so important. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not like something where they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get \\xe2\\x80\\x93 like there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s big disputes and we understand that. This is something everybody agrees \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the money should pour into this country and we should use the money and all the things \\xe2\\x80\\x93 taxes paid.\\nBut they agree and they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get it doen because of gridlock and incompetent leadership.\\nYou know, honestly, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think anybody can say. She says she is. But now she says all of a sudden maybe less so than you thought because she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going very, very far over to the other side.\\nI mean, Bernie Sanders has brought her to positions that she didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to be at. You look at some of the things that she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s saying right now.\\nBut I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what, whether she is or not, she doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the strength or the energy to help Israel. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m telling you she doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6But just take a look. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll come out and do an event and you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see her for another four days, three days, five days. No, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true.\\nThink of it. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need \\xe2\\x80\\x93 some people say it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not nice to say. She doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the strength or the energy.\\nIsrael needs more than just our support. They need strength. They need real power behind them.\\nBecause you know, you look at as these countries fall over there, Israel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s looking more and more \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, Israel has some difficulties.\\nAnd one thing and I think you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll all admit it. These people are fighting really dirty but they fight a lot better than we used to think. Right? We used to think \"Oh, that was easy.\"\\n15 years ago with my friends from Israel because I have a lot of friends from Israel, they used to smile and laugh \"Oh, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry about it.\" Now they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re saying, \"These guys are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re dirty fighters.\" And they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not bad. You know, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re tough. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not the JV. Okay? Obama said they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the JV. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not the JV folks.\\nWe need tough. We need General George Patton. We need General MacArthur. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need the guys we have. I see them on television \\xe2\\x80\\x93 generals. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want my generals on television saying \"Well, ISIS is very tough.\"\\nI saw a guy the other day. ISIS is very tough. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need that.\\nDo you think General George Patton \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like him because he was a foul mouth vicious horrible brilliant guy. So he would never make it. They probably would have had him thrown out years ago.\\nBut we need Patton. We need a genius like MacArthur.\\nAnd we have those people. We have those people. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll find that person.\\nBut we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to knock the crap out of them, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win.\\nWell, I think radical Islam right now is, and I feel that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the greatest. And again, we have a president who refuses to use the term.\\nBut radical Islam is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you one thing I know isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t is global warming. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the one thing\\xe2\\x80\\xa6I know isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\nI mean, we have a guy that just the other day who said \\xe2\\x80\\x93 here they want to blow everything \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this is right after Paris. They want to blow our cities up. They want to destroy our civilization, and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worried about global warming, which a lot of people think is a hoax.\\nBy the way, I won so many environmental awards shockingly. No, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true.\\nAnd you know what I want to do? I want really immaculate air. I want clean, crystal water. I want a lot of things. Okay? I want a lot of things.\\nBut global warming \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you noticed they changed the name \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they go global warming, they go climate change, they go \\xe2\\x80\\x93 now I hear a lot of extreme weather. How can you miss with extreme weather, right? If it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cold, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s okay. If it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hot, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s okay. If it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s windy, if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hot \\xe2\\x80\\x93 everything is extreme. So now they use extreme weather. It is a disgrace what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on.\\nAnd to have this man embarrass us by standing up and saying that global warming is our biggest threat, we got to get him out so fast and thank goodness we only have a year left.\\nThank you. Thank you very much everybody.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great honor. I want to thank Simon and Schuster, one of the most magnificent publishers. For years and years, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard about Simon and Schuster\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being a fabulous \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I was going to say the Rolls-Royce, I was going to say the Harvard or the Yale, but they really are a great one. And I want to thank you very much. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve given us such tremendous support.\\nAnd we did this quickly and I think we did it very effectively. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been an incredible experience.\\nWe wrote a book and the title \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"Crippled America\" \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is very tough but unfortunately we have to do what we have to do and I think one of the reasons we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been doing so well in the campaign is because we tell it like it is. We tell the truth.\\nAnd America is crippled. We owe $17 [trillion] and now $18 [trillion] and now it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actually very soon going to be $19 trillion in debt.\\nWe have a military that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have proper instruction from leadership. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re losing all over the world with trade deals. Every country, no matter what country you talk about, you can just pick a name out of a hat, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re beating us in trade.\\nAnd we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go on like this any longer. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impossible to go on like this any longer.\\nI always mention as an example Sergeant Bergdahl, a traitor. We get Sergeant Bergdahl; they get five of the people they wanted and they wanted badly. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the way it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to work anymore.\\nSo we write about it in the book. We tell lots of different stories of lots of different things. And I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be very instructional, very important.\\nTo me, it was instructional.\\nWhen I did \"The Art of the Deal\", I think one of the reasons it was so successful is that it was largely instructional. Even today when I speak, so many people hold up the book \"The Art of the Deal\" and the other books we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done.\\nSo this is one that probably not since the Art of the Deal, I have to tell this to Louise and Simon and Schuster, have I worked so hard on a book and it was in a confined period of time. We wanted to get it out really, really quickly so that it pertain to what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on right now. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a moment of time. And we got it done.\\nAnd David did a fantastic job\\xe2\\x80\\xa6And all of my people did a great job. They helped me so much because we are doing a couple of other things right now. So this was not easy getting this in.\\nBut we see by the lines \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the lines go down to Park Avenue. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been forming since last night and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to be signing books starting at 12 p.m. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing a couple of interviews and then we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re signing books starting at 12 p.m. and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be very exciting for me.\\nBut we have fans that have bought the book and they just bought it and some have been online now for 12 and 14 hours. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing this but they do it. They find a way.\\nSo I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m looking forward to getting to the signings.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\nWell, I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a different book. You know, we just had polls come out today from Iowa where I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m leading. You saw the new poll from Iowa. You saw the new poll in New Hampshire where I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m leading big.\\nA poll just came out in Florida where I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m leading big. Georgia, Texas. I mean, all over the place.\\nAnd I think you know look we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing well. And if you add Ben and myself we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re beating everybody by a lot. That seems to be the big story that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re beating \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they call it the establishment. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called really the failed establishment because the establishment has let us down.\\nBut I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how his book is doing.\\nWell, I think my book is very hard-hitting. His is a different kind of book and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a different kind of a person. My book is very hard-hitting. It says it like it is. And based on what Simon and Schusters just told me, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s selling like hotcakes. So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re very different people. We have very different qualities and we are extremely different. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m different from all of the other candidates.\\nLook, nobody can negotiate trade deals like me.\\nWe are going to take the $400 billion a year that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re losing with China, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be turned around. The $75 billion a year that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re short on with Japan.\\nThe $50 billion a year that we lost to Mexico. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right, there will be a wall built. It will go up. It will be built. And people will come into the country legally.\\nSo I mean, much different than \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re look at Marco Rubio \\xe2\\x80\\x93 very, very weak on illegal immigration.\\nYou look at Ben and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very weak on immigration and he wants to get rid of Medicare. I mean, Ben wants to get rid of Medicare. You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get rid of Medicare. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be a horrible thing to get rid of. It actually works. You get rid of the fraud, waste, and abuse. It works. So when a man is weak on immigration and wants to get rid of Medicare, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how he stays here.\\nNo, I think that really Marco is over-rated. And frankly had Bush been a better messenger, he has the better message. I mean, if that was me delivering that message it would have been a much different story because he hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been able to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Marco doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t show up to the United States Senate. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s representing the people of Florida, which by the way that poll just came out today and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m way up in Florida over everybody.\\nBut Marco is a sitting Senator and he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t show up for the people of Florida, and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think he should be doing that.\\nNow, Bush gave a very weak message. I agree with that. It was poorly delivered. But the facts are on Bush\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side and ultimately I think Marco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be hurt very badly.\\nAnd if you look at Mr. Singer, you have to see where Mr. Singer is coming from and when you see where he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coming from, I think people are going to say, \"Whoa, we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that.\"\\nBut look at Marco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stance on illegal immigration. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really trouble for him. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see how he can win.\\nMarco Rubio\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal finances are discredit\\xe2\\x80\\xa6All you have to do is look at his credit card. I mean, he is a disaster with his credit cards. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what, I love Florida. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in Florida all the time. And for years, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been hearing that his credit cards are disaster. I would think that when you take a look at it, you would find that.\\nBut his credit card debt and his problems with credit card and what he did when he was running the party apparatus with credit cards, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard about it for years. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to find out.\\nWell, he has a very bad record of finances if you look at what happened with his houses, with his \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, he certainly lives above his means. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no question about that.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what. On the debates, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very interesting. Because I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really care that much. I want a room. I want a podium. And let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s get going. Because I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really care that much.\\nBut a lot of the people that are candidates who I respect \\xe2\\x80\\x93 many of them, not all of them \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but I respect many of them, they felt it was very unfair because Hillary Clinton was given all soft balls. I mean, she wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t asked one tough question. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk about her foundation. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk about any of the problems. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk about the emails. When the email problem came up, Bernie Sanders lost his whole campaign. I mean, what he did was so stupid from his standpoint. In order to get a one-minute soundbite of some applause, he gave up the emails. That was end of his campaign.\\nFirst of all, people aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to his rallies anymore. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s finished.\\nSo unless something happens to her with respect to the emails, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll easily be the candidate.\\nBut I will say this: She only got softballs. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all she got.\\nAnd if you look at the way we were treated, it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the same way.\\nWith that being said, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really care.\\nWell, I think the Republicans actually are doing a pretty good job overall. They coalesced at that last debate because I mean, it really started with me. The guy asked me a question. I think Harwood is probably finished as a credible reporter. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a disaster. And he was \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it was such as horribly put question and so obvious.\\nAnd the Republicans coalesced around each other. It was actually pretty beautiful when you think about it.\\nAnd all we want to do is to be treated fairly.\\nBut with me, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care that much. Just give me a podium.\\nWhat I would say is this: The networks have made a fortune because of me, not because of anybody else.\\nYou know, they were saying that the last cycle, they had 2 million and 1 million people and the networks didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even want to broadcast it because nobody watched. Okay? Nobody wanted to watch.\\nNow, they have 25 million people, 24 million people, 23 million people and 16 million people. I mean, give me a break.\\nSo somebody said, \"How did they get there?\"\\nAnd actually Variety and Hollywood Reporter, who do report this stuff pretty well \\xe2\\x80\\x93 much better than the political press \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they said \"solely for one reason \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it was Trump\". I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take the credit.\\nBut I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what I also want. I think that Wounded Warriors and our veterans should be given some of the enormous profits being made on these debates \\xe2\\x80\\x93 enormous profits \\xe2\\x80\\x93 by the way beyond anything they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever envisioned.\\nCNN was going to get $2,000 for a 30 second ad. They ended up getting $250,000. So they went from $2,000 to $250,000 for a 30 second ad.\\nThe networks and the cable are making a fortune, and I think they should give some of the profits to the Wounded Warriors and the veterans. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I want.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m giving them away. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m giving the profits of my book \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m giving them away to a lot of different \\xe2\\x80\\x93 including the vets.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6I have been amazing with respect to the hiring of women. This building was built as the head person who was fantastic by a woman and that was at a time when you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see that in the construction trades. I mean, it was totally unique.\\nI have many, many executives upstairs and in different buildings that I have that are women. Many \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a proportion that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s close to 50%. Might even be over 50% if I analyze it. And they get paid a lot of money \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in many cases more than men doing the same job.\\nSo women have always appreciated that about me. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been in terms of employment really a standout and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been honored for doing so well with women.\\nWhat Jeb Bush was saying at the last debate? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. But he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say it well.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6I like Telemundo by the way. I like it better than Univision. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m suing Univision for $500 million.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6Because the country is doing so poorly. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very accurate title because the country is doing so poorly.\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have some demonstrations. Oh, good because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get even higher ratings if they do that. I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fine. I think they should demonstrate. Ratings will go even higher than they are going to be. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be one of the highest rated shows ever. And they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re very excited about it.\\nAnd I have a great relationship, as you know from Telemundo, with the Hispanics. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve treated me actually very fairly. Won the poll recently in Nevada. Won other polls. And in Nevada, I think I got 37% and leading everybody.\\nSo I have a great relationship with the Hispanics. I have working for me thousands right now \\xe2\\x80\\x93 thousands of Hispanics. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had tens of thousands of people over the year working for me. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a job machine. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a job machine.\\nAnd one of the things that does come out in every single poll and every single survey is that nobody for the economy nobody is even close. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m two, three, and you see that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 two, three, four, five times greater than anybody else.\\nAnd you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d almost say like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about the jobs, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about the economy. Then how\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anybody going to beat Trump in all fairness?\\nBut I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had a great relationship with the workers. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had a great relationship with jobs. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had an amazing relationship with the Hispanics. And I predict that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to win the Hispanic vote.\\nI think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to win the Hispanic vote. I predict, yeah, I think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to get the nomination and I will win the White House. I think beating Hillary Clinton is going to be easy because her record is so bad.\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the question I like. How am I preparing for my SNL? Well, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m meeting with Lorne Michaels in a little while. Afterwards, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to sign \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I guess got thousands of people on line but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to sign and then later on this evening I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m meeting with Lorne Michaels and the whole staff and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll start the preparation. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll pick our skits. Am I nervous? Not too nervous. Not too nervous. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do a good job and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going have a fantastic show. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all going to have a lot of fun.\\nMy Jeb impression? No, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to do that. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like showing a person sleeping at the podium.\\nTom is asking \"Can Jeb make a comeback?\" I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be very hard. Very hard. Not about money. I just think \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, I came up with the energy. And I just think we need tremendous energy because we need a person that has tremendous personal energy to get us back on track. You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that when you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have that.\\nI think Marco is highly overrated. Highly overrated. He doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have it and all you have to do is look at his stance on things.\\nJeb \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he lacks the quality that you need.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about everybody in the world is ripping us off. You need a very strong person with tremendous energy. Thank you very much folks, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take the job.\\nBut and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so important. And by the way, Ben Carson does not have that energy.\\nWe need somebody with tremendous energy to straighten out the military, to straighten out ISIS, to straighten out our horrible trade deals, to terminate Obamacare and come up with something far better for far less money. You need somebody with tremendous personal energy as President.\\nWe have a president right now that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have energy. I mean, you think Obama has energy? He has no energy. And he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been a horrible president.\\nWe need somebody with great personal energy as a leader so that we can make great deals with other countries and do well in every other respect. And certainly Jeb does not have that energy in my opinion.\\nFrom the Guardian. Ah, they treat me very nicely in Scotland. Go ahead.\\nWell, we just went over that. Honestly, we just went over that. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only going to make it harder.\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to see what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to see. But the whole thing with anchor babies, I turned out to be right. A person has a baby, lives in Mexico or lives in Asia or lives in many different place, has a baby, walks across the border, has the baby here. Now, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re responsible for that person for the next 85 years. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think so.\\nAnd by the way, I was right, they were wrong. The 14th Amendment does not give them clearance on that.\\nAnd if you wanted to do that in Mexico or if you wanted to do that in almost any other country where you have a baby in that country and that country has that person for 85 years including all of the costs of that person, they would laugh you right out of the country. You would be laughed out of the country so fast.\\nSo, that turned out \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I was 100% right. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to worry about that. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take care of it, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be done in a very humane way.\\nBut we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to bring back our country and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have a wall and Mexico\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to pay for the wall and you know why they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to pay? And I have great relationships with Mexico and phenomenal relationships with the Mexican people. Phenomenal. And they buy apartments from me; they work for me by the thousands \\xe2\\x80\\x93 by the thousands. Phenomenal relationships.\\nBut let me just tell you we lose so much money with Mexico in terms of trade imbalance \\xe2\\x80\\x93 $45 billion last year. Plus, we give Mexico billions and billions of dollars. They will pay for the wall. And it will be very interesting.\\nAnd you know what? People are going to come into this country but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to come in legally.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6A lot of European countries are going to build walls to stop the immigration.\\nWell, walls work. All you have to do is ask Israel. Walls work if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s properly constructed. Not the walls that these characters, these politicians that we have running our country who are a disgrace \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all talk, no action politicians \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they build a wall this big, they drive cars right through it.\\nWalls work. All you have to do is go and see Israel. They will tell you that walls work.\\nWe need pomp and circumstance. Our country has no spirit. Our country has no gravitas. Our country doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel good about itself. And the primary reason is we have no victories. I mean, where have we had a victory? Where have we had a victory in trade? Where have we had a victory as an example this horrible deal that was signed with Iran where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve given them $150 billion and we lose everything. We lose everything. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a laughing stock. Worst deal. Worst contract I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen drawn.\\nWe have no victories. And I do write about it. We need some pomp and circumstance. We need spirit. We need a cheerleader.\\nI thought seven years ago when Obama got elected, the one thing I thought that he would be a great cheerleader for this country. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been a great divider for the country. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been one of the great dividers of all time.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not saying dress. It has nothing to do with dress. It has to do with the fact that what he says is very divisive. He has been a great divider for this country, and that should not have happened.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go anyway they want. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care too much about the debates. Look, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the one that gets all the nasty questions anyway. Nobody else gets the really nasty questions. In a certain way, maybe they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re defending me although I will tell you they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not doing it for that reason.\\nI think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s irrelevant. I just \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I like the debates. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had the debates. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done well in the debates. As you know, every single poll said I won all three debates. Now, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if I did or not but I certainly didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do badly. But every single poll says \\xe2\\x80\\x93 even CNBC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s poll said I won the debate.\\nSo I like the debates. I think they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re good for me. But we have to be treated a little bit fairly.\\nAs an example, Hillary Clinton \\xe2\\x80\\x93 no tough questions. I mean, why didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they ask about Bill? Why didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they ask about all of the different things. No tough questions. Now, that was staged by the Democrats. And frankly, they did a very smart thing in the way they staged it.\\nWell, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to stage something properly also.\\nBut as far as I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m concerned, I really don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care that much. I just want a debate. I think debating is a good thing. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s healthy. Gets everything into the open.\\nBut you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want people like Harwood that read a question \\xe2\\x80\\x93 blah, blah, blah \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that he wrote \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that he carefully wrote. He thought he was such \\xe2\\x80\\x93 his career \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in my opinion, his career is probably ruined or certainly threatened.\\nHe could ask about anything you want. I mean, you have to ask about anything you want. Hillary had only softballs. All night long. It was like this \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"Here, Hillary, hit this one out of the park.\"\\nAre you from Russia? All right. I think our relationship with Russia will be very good. Vladimir Putin was on 60 Minutes with me three weeks ago. Right? Putin. And they have one of the highest ratings they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had in a long time. So I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to give him total credit. But we will have a very good relationship I think with Russia.\\nNow, maybe we won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. But I believe we will have a very good relationship with Russia. I believe that I will have a very good relationship with Putin.\\nSounds okay to me.\\nWell, I think there are a lot of economic issues. We didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk about trade. We didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk about devaluations. Right? We didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk about corporate inversions, which by the way, none of the other candidates, they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know what it means.\\nBut we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk about corporate inversions where companies are leaving our country \\xe2\\x80\\x93 massive companies \\xe2\\x80\\x93 because they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get their money back and because they get lower taxes elsewhere. So they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leaving and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re taking their jobs with them.\\nThe corporate inversion syndrome is a very important thing to be talking about.\\nThese were all things that weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talked about at the debate. Instead, they talked about fantasy football. I mean, it was a big question \\xe2\\x80\\x93 fantasy football. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m saying what about corporate inversions? $2.5 trillion at least. I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably twice that number is in other countries wanting to come back and because our system is so corrupt and terrible, they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get the money back to invest in this country.\\nSo they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk about corporate inversions at the debates. They talk about fantasy football. Those are the few.\\nI was against the war in Iraq. You know, it was very early on. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll give it to you. Yeah, I have it upstairs\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\nWell, you know, you have to understand, I was a developer. A lot of people didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care about my view in 2003 and 2004. But there was a Reuters article taken from a magazine about my stance in 2004, I believe, in July of 2004 and it talked about my stance on how I felt about Iraq. And I said very strongly exactly what happened. I said you will destabilize the Middle East and when you destabilize the Middle East, Iran will take over Iraq. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exactly what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening. And they will take over the oil reserves, which are among the largest in the world, and in addition other bad things will happen. The other bad things are ISIS. I said that in 2004 and that was an article that was taken from a magazine which was previous to that. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve felt that for a long time.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6Do I think that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time for some of the other Republicans in the race that registering zero \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in a couple of places they have a zero with an arrow pointing left, which I assume is a mistake because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s less than zero. I assume that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not happening. Do I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time to have some of the other Republican candidates drop out? Yes. There are too many people. Well, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to get personal but you can look at the poll numbers.\\nLook, if a person is campaigning for four or five months and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re at 0% or 1% or 2%, they should get out.\\nLike, you know, look at me. I go to Florida and look at the numbers that just came out in Florida. 37%? Georgia. I mean, those are real numbers. These numbers that these people have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I often ask myself. I asked Mark yesterday, \"What are they doing? Do they do this for their brand? Because I happen to think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very bad for their brand.\"\\nI think [Scott] Walker did a good thing. I think the way Walker \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he saw it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happening, wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to happen and he just got out quickly. You know, he was favored. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget. You know. That was before Trump was going to happen. Right? But he was favored for a period of time. Favored. Walker. Gov. Walker. They thought he was going to win.\\nWhat happened is he got out.\\nI think the way he got out was great. I think he did a really smart thing for himself.\\nAnd frankly, other people should get out because I would like to personally have more time to talk about the problems of the United States and more importantly how we can solve the problems. So it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great question. People should get out.\\nIvanka. Oh, they just said one of the biggest applause lines \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I get is when I talk about my daughter Ivanka. She was just at Fortune Magazine for like something like Woman of the Year which is great\\xe2\\x80\\xa6But Ivanka is going to be very involved and Melania is going to be very involved very soon. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be coming out very soon.\\nOh, Ivanka is going to Iowa. When are you going to Iowa? Very soon.\\nI would say \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see threats. I mean, whatever it is I have to do. Mark is saying \"What are the top threats to your candidacy?\" Who knows? I mean, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in the crazy world of politics. People change their minds.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to make America great again. Nobody else is going to be able to do that. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do it.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to make it in my opinion better than ever before, and I think that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s awfully tough to compete with.\\nAnd one of the reasons that in my book I actually put financials in there \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I showed some of the developments that \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I have many, many more because you can only \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Simon and Schuster \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you actually kept me to eight or nine pages. Right? And there are four or five in a page. But I show some of the great developments that I have done that are so successful and so incredible and so financially good, I show my financial statement from a year and a half, two years ago. Now it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s even better but we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have that certified yet.\\nSo I do that not in a braggadocious way. I do that because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the kind of thinking our country needs right now.\\nWe are run by people that are incompetent. We are run by people who in so many words \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I hate to use the word stupid but you have to use that word. Unless they have bad intentions which I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe they do. But we are run by incompetent people. We have incompetent leadership.\\nThere are so many things. Like I mentioned corporate inversion. The Democrats want the money to come back. Who doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t? The Republicans want the money to come back. For three years, the Democrats have said we want the money to come back. For three years, the Democrats and the Republicans agree 100%. You have a vast majority. Maybe everybody. For three years. Guess what? They haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t done anything. Right? They can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even get along when they agree.\\nSo here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the thing where we can take trillions of dollars, bring it back to this country, rebuild big parts of our country with it, companies can spend that money in our country, we have everybody agrees it should be done for years and they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a part of the problem.\\nWell, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to look \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a lot of controversy with Mr. Singer. A lot of controversy with Mr. Singer. There are those people that probably wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have want him to back. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll talk to you.\\nNo, they all agree. They all agree. They just didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to go through the unfair questions because they weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t questions; they were statements.\\nYou see, they were asking \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they were giving statements in a sarcastic, disgusting way.\\nAnd by the way, I think Becky is terrific and I think Carl is terrific. But I think John Harwood is not very good at what he does. But I think Becky Quick is a terrific person. I think Carl is a terrific person. But I will tell you John Harwood was a disgrace to CNBC.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6The question is should the Fed raise rates? They are not raising them because Obama has asked them not to raise them. In my opinion, he wants to get out of office because we are in a bubble and when those rates are raised, a lot of bad things are going to happen or potentially going to happen. And in my opinion, Janet Yellen is highly political and she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not raising rates for a very specific reason because Obama told her not to because he wants to be out playing golf in a year from now and he wants to be doing other things and he doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to see a big bubble burst during his administration. Janet Yellen should have raised the rates. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not doing it because the Obama administration and the president doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want her to. And if she does it, you see what happens every time there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s even a thought of raising them just a little bit.\\nAnd one of the problems that we have is our currency right now is not competitive with other currencies. Because if you look at the devaluations of China, of Japan, of many, many different countries, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re making it impossible for our companies to compete with them because we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have leaders that know how to say to China, \"Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that. Because if you do that, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to put a big fat tax on you. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that.\" And you know what? If you said that, they wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it. If you have the right messenger\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m really focused on one very big election, one very important election, and there are some pretty good elections. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not watching any of them in particular. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be watching them on Tuesday night. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be out there; we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be out voting.\\nBut the election that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m watching is the election for the presidency of the United States. That is going to be in my opinion this will be truly one of the most important elections we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever had in this country. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re so far behind. And we cannot go another four years with incompetent leadership.\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good question. Okay. So, Simon and Schuster came up to me. They wanted to do a book. They wanted to do on success and how do you do this and how do you build it and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what the book is largely about but we talked so much about the country. And I said, \"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do it but we have to talk about the country.\"\\nWhat happened is they sent this incredible photographer up to do a book cover, do to a picture. And he did some great\\xe2\\x80\\xa6photos. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m smiling. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m happy. I look good. Everything was fine. And then he took one where I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like really thinking about a photo and then it turned out to be a nasty picture. And then the book was written and the title was given and the only really terrible picture I had was that one. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a terrible, horrible, nasty picture. But when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about \"Crippled America\" and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about all of the problems we have, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have a big smiley face up there. So that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how we picked it. We picked the worst photo taken of me.\\nI would have loved to have a beautiful smiling picture but somehow that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go with the title of the book or frankly the content of the book, and actually Simon and Schuster agreed with me. Okay?\\nAre the other Republicans afraid to debate? Well, some of them should be.\\nThank you very much everybody. Thank you.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6I was telling some of the folks backstage, I never ever thought we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d do this well this fast. This has been so incredible. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happened all over. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happened in Iowa. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been really incredible.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had some amazing results and they continue to come in.\\nGot a little shake-up in Iowa. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on.\\nSomebody said \"Are you going straight to New Hampshire?\" Now, I love New Hampshire. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got great numbers. 38 to 12. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good.\\nBut we fell a little behind in Iowa, and some people are saying how can it be. And I come out and I was just telling a group we have the biggest crowds, we have the most enthusiastic crowds.\\nEverybody said and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very true. I mean, look at this. Somebody else would come, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have like 50 people and they wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need this room. Believe me.\\nBut everybody said without question in every poll \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just here \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that the people that are with Trump are with Trump. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go anywhere. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re staying. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. I see it. I see it.\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen it.\\nYou know, a couple of times I say \"Well, that could be the end.\" Then they do something and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m 10 points up. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the craziest thing, right? But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take it.\\nBut they say the people are with \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we have the most loyal people by far. Everybody says it.\\nThe other thing they say is for leadership, number one. Very important, right? Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you think? Leadership.\\nI mean, when leadership is number one \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they say on the economy without question number one and by a lot.\\nSo you know it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great.\\nI thought I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d talk a little bit and I want to take some questions. You know, we can do a little question and answer. Right?\\nWe have all these cameras going back here. And you know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always tough when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re on live television all the time.\\nLook, we have 10 topics. Right? How many topics? 10? How many different ways can you talk about the 10 topics?\\nThe bottom line is we want results. We want to get it done. But when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re on live television all the time all those people back there and the cameras are on and then you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about immigration and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about the wall because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have a wall and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to stop illegal immigration.\\nBut we talk about trade and we talk about repealing Obamacare. And we talk about all the things that we talk about.\\nBut you know, you have these points and we could talk about them in different forms, in different ways and give different examples. But in the end, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really about results. Isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really about results.\\nAnd you can only talk about the same subjects on live television so many different ways.\\nI talk about industry. I talk about commerce. I talk about how we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re losing our jobs to all of these different countries. And I give different examples.\\nBut it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still going to be a certain number of subjects.\\nI talk about Second Amendment. I talk about Fourteenth Amendment. We talk about amendments.\\nYou know, that Second Amendment, they want to take it away from you. They really want to do things and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen. At least with me it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen. That I can tell you.\\nSo I said today you know we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll talk for a little while but I want to do some questions and answers. I want you people to excite me for a change. Is that okay? I want to be excited. And so we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have some fun. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do that.\\nA few things \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I want to bring up a few new subjects.\\nSo, immigration, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be doing a very strong number. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s killing us. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s killing us. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bad for the economy. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bad for \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all of this illegal immigration.\\nAnd I have to tell you legal \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you come in and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have a good time and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be there and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do great \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and visas \\xe2\\x80\\x93 maybe work, maybe there are cases where you need people in and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do something, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to hurt our economy in any way, shape or form. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make our economy much, much stronger.\\nBut we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re also going to get jobs for people that are here. People with us. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get jobs. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get jobs.\\nBut the illegal immigration \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, I did this and I made my determination \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I took a deep breath. Because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what, it takes courage to say I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to run for president. It really does, especially in my case where I have a great business and I love my business. I love doing it. I may never even see it.\\nI mean, I own some of the great properties in the world. Doral in Miami. I may never see it again\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Turnberry in Scotland, one of the greatest homes of the British Open and all of that. I may never see it again.\\nAll of these incredible places that I have.\\nBut more than that, it takes courage because when you do it, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re putting yourself out there beyond anything that anybody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s done and it even takes courage for a politician to do it.\\nNow at some point some of these guys have to leave. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we agree? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s getting ridiculous.\\nBecause like tomorrow night we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re having a debate, and I wish we had more time for the debate. Not in terms of three hours because who wants three hours? You know, I could stand up for 20 hours if I had to but who wants to watch that long?\\nHillary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s debate essentially lasted for an hour and a half and I was \\xe2\\x80\\x93 oh \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it was \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t watch it.\\nYou have Hillary against a socialist/communist. And honestly, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to win. Just so you understand\\xe2\\x80\\xa6He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to win and neither is she\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\nWell, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being totally protected because in theory she shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even be allowed to run. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being protected.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a tough game and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nasty game but she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s being totally protected.\\nBut she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to beat him and you still have one more of these guys. O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Malley. So he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be out quickly, I guess. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s he doing. What do they do when they have zero? They have zero.\\nAnd I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say it against our folks. But they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve treated me \\xe2\\x80\\x93 some of the zeroes have treated me so nastily, right? Because they want to start controversy and they want to try pick up some points.\\nAnd you know what? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to even mention names. Usually I do. I love doing it. But everybody that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hit me so far has gone down. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gone down. And they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gone down bigly.\\nAnd a couple of the ones and zeroes \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the ones that hit the hardest. I mean, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re like desperate people. But they hit.\\nOne of them has a zero with an arrow pointing to the left. That means less than zero. And I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand. What does it mean? I assume it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a typo but maybe not.\\nBut when you look at the things that are happening with our country \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the trade situation with not just China \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I talk about China all the time because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the main abuser, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the biggest abuser. The numbers are astronomical. Almost $400 billion a year in terms of imbalance. Think of it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 $400 billion a year.\\nAnd they send stuff over here but we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t send stuff over there. They tax us. Big tax.\\nA friend of mine can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get stuff over there. The tax is so big. Big tax.\\nSomebody bought an airplane in China here. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get it over there. Spoiled guy. Rich guy. Bought a beautiful plane. Can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get it over there because the tax is so massive that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s now selling in this country because China won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let him have the plane and he has to pay a tax.\\nI won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even tell you what the tax is. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so astronomical that I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even believe them myself. So I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to say it because those guys will say \"Well, he was wrong.\" All I can tell you is it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a massive tax. Like you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t buy planes here because if you do, you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be able to get them back in.\\nAnd here, we accept all of their products.\\nSo we have almost a $400 billion trade imbalance with China.\\nWe have a $70 billion trade imbalance with Japan.\\nWe have a \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, with all that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on in the South China Sea and you look where we have a destroyer \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a relatively small ship \\xe2\\x80\\x93 over there, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d want to be the captain of that ship right now. But they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re being sort of mocked and scorned and a lot of bad things can happen.\\nBut you know, we have an agreement with Japan and I love Japan. I love China. I love all these people. But their leaders are killing us because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re smarter, sharper, more cunning.\\nThe leaders of Mexico are killing us at the border and in trade. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re taking so many of our companies.\\nEven Nabisco \\xe2\\x80\\x93 my Oreos \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re taking Nabisco. Right? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m never eating Oreos. I tell it all the time. They had some Oreos before on the plane and I said I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to touch them. Bring them back. I yelled out to bring them back.\\nBut I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not happy. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leaving Chicago and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re moving their big plant to Mexico.\\nSo when you see this happening, we have to stop it.\\nAnd I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to beat around the bush and \"Oh, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talk and let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s be nice and let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s say \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \" Nobody can do it like I do it. Nobody. Honestly, nobody.\\nWe can \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not saying I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m perfect because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not perfect. Nobody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perfect\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\nNow, nobody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perfect. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you when it comes to that stuff I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m really \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nobody better.\\nCarl Icahn endorsed me the other day. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the great traders, one of the great dealmakers. He says Trump, Trump. And he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not somebody that just do it. He wants somebody that knows what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing. He understand.\\nYou talk about corporate inversions and all of the things that have been going on.\\nCorporate inversions. You know, many of the companies in this country have trillions of dollars cumulatively. They think $2.5 trillion overseas right now. They can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get it in.\\nAnd everybody agrees that we should bring it in. The Democrats and the Republicans. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve agreed for years. They can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make a deal because they have no leader.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not like \"Oh gee, we disagree on Obamacare. Or we disagree on something else.\"\\nAlthough I must tell you many of the Democrats that I speak to because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m friendly with all of them. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m friendly with like Republicans. I get a long with everybody.\\nYou know, everybody says \"Oh, you won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be a unifier\". I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be the greatest unifier of all. Why is Obama a unifier?\\nBut I will tell you many of the Democrats who voted for Obamacare would never have done it now and were lied to 28 times. Right? \"You can keep your doctor, keep your plan, keep your this, everything\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be great.\" Turned out to be a total lie. 28 different times that they know of and they wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have done it.\\nBut when you look at what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening with corporations and the highest tax \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we pay the highest tax anywhere in the world of any country \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but they have trillions of dollars overseas. And these are great companies in many cases. They have thousands of employees. They can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get their money back.\\nAnd the reason is bureaucracy. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very hard.\\nAnd also big reason the tax is too high. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to bring $1 million back and pay $300,000 or $350,000 tax. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99d rather leave it over there.\\nAnd if they bring it back, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be using it to invest in our country. I mean, a lot of good things will happen.\\nI happen to believe it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more than $2.5 trillion.\\nBut here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the thing and I use it because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so incredible. Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the thing. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not controversial. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not like you have the Republicans here and you have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 everybody agrees. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve agreed you know that for 2.5, 3 years. They can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make a deal.\\nAnd now what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening and this will be the next great story is companies are leaving the United States \\xe2\\x80\\x93 two reasons \\xe2\\x80\\x93 lower taxes but also to get their money. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got billions of dollars overseas. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leaving our country in order to get their money and in order to pay lower tax.\\nAnd you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about one company I know of \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how much they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve written about it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about 6,000 jobs just one company. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about potentially thousands of companies.\\nAnd I say it, in the old days, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d leave New York. People would move down and companies would move down to Florida or they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d move to Texas or they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d leave New Jersey, where taxes are quite high, and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d move to another location. Right? Now, they leave our country and they go to other countries. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happened.\\nIn the world of the Internet and the world of very fast jets, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a different world out there.\\nAnd there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no loyalty. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re paid a lot of money to make a lot of money for their shareholders and some of them are actually foreign; they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to move back to these countries.\\nThey bring in executives that are from Ireland, from other places. And they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have loyalty to the United States.\\nSo my plan, my tax plan, is something I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very proud of. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to solve corporate inversion.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what, we will have that money back \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if I get elected president, that money will be back so fast your head will spin. Nobody else will be able to do it. Nobody.\\nHonestly, nobody else even knows about it. The other candidates, most of them don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know about it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not their wheelhouse. Okay? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not their thing. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not their thing.\\nTheir thing is getting re-elected. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re good at. They get re-elected. And they make promises and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all talk and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re no action. And the same things happen with these politicians. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always the same.\\nSo we have so many different things and what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done with our tax plan, which something I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very proud of, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve brought it down to a few groups.\\nBecause right now, you have to go out \\xe2\\x80\\x93 people who aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t doing well go out and hire companies to help them with their tax plans. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll pay $500, $1,000 because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so complicated.\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make it nice and simple.\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting rid of carried interest, which is something that a lot of rich hedge fund guys love. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting rid of it. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t love me so much anymore. But I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care.\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting rid of a lot of things.\\nSo we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have a nice simple tax return.\\nSomebody said \"Oh, why isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t everybody paying?\"\\nYou know, 40% \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a big percentage \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will not pay any tax at all. People that are doing badly.\\nThey said \\xe2\\x80\\x93 well, I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use the candidates\\xe2\\x80\\x99 name because I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to insult any candidate when they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t defend themselves. They said \"We want everybody to pay at least something.\" And I said, \"I agree.\"\\nHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the problem. From the standpoint of bookkeeping, from the standpoint of bureaucracy, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about millions and millions of returns. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about building the IRS even bigger and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a monster. And I could cut it down way down. And the money that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about is far less than the administrative costs.\\nSo I said, \"I agree. Except for one thing from a practical standpoint, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too much. Most of these people aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t paying anyway.\"\\nWhat I want to do is bring our jobs back from China, bring our jobs back from Mexico, bring fairness to our deals as an example with Japan.\\nI was in Los Angeles. Ships \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the biggest ships you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen. Cars are pouring off into this country. Made in Japan. We give them practically nothing.\\nThe balance is so bad. The imbalance is so bad. And then we have all the strikes.\\nSee, what our people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know and only somebody that wrote \"The Art of the Deal\" or does this stuff. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s natural. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like a great athlete. Like a Jack Nicklaus. He was always able to sink that putt. Right? You know, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just better. And you have athletes \\xe2\\x80\\x93 very few \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but there are some people that have a certain ability.\\nA lot of people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know we have all the power. We have all the power in China.\\nYou know, we owe right now China and Japan equally $1.5 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 think of this \\xe2\\x80\\x93 trillion. $1.5 trillion. Think of this. They take our business and in the case of Japan, mostly cars. But they take our business. They take our jobs. Factories close down all over the place. And we owe them money. Right? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a magic act. For them not for us. For us it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a horror show.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to end. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to end.\\nAnd people like Carl Icahn and the people like the best negotiators \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I know the best negotiators in the world. Some I think are horrible people. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be honest with you. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care. Do you care if they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re horrible people? Who cares?\\nNow, Carl happens to be actually a very nice guy but he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a brilliant negotiator and a tough cookie and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s built a fortune. He doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want money. He doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to say, \"Oh, give me $200,000 a year in government money.\" He wants to do it. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proud to do it. He wants to help the country. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so easy for him.\\nFor instance, if I say \"Carl, do me a favor. The trade deal we have with China is so unfair we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re losing $400 billion a year. Carl, do me a favor. Make it fair.\" I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to give him a big speech. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to give him a big speech.\\nI mean, I can tell you that within a very, very short period of time, things will straighten out. I mean, things will straighten out and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be our benefit.\\nBut think of it, if we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re losing that kind of money \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that imbalance. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an imbalance. Some people will say \"That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not really a loss.\" It is a loss. If we have that kind of imbalance and suppose you brought it back to zero or even if we lost $100 billion a year, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot of money. Believe me, I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sleep.\\nIf I brought it to $100 billion a year, get rid of me in four years, all right?\\nBut suppose we brought it back to $100 billion or we brought it back to zero, do you know what that means to this country? Do you know the kind of money you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about? Then jobs will start coming back, lots of good things would happen. Lots of great things would happen.\\nAnd maybe our babies who have all these toys all over the place, maybe they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have 75% and maybe they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll like them better. Maybe they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be better. And they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be manufactured here.\\nWhenever I order television sets, I ordered thousands and thousands of television sets a year for different jobs. And whenever I order them, they all come from South Korea. They make all the television \\xe2\\x80\\x93 other than Sony but Sony has sort of lost its way a little bit. Sony is Japan.\\nBut South Korea \\xe2\\x80\\x93 LG, Samsung. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get bids from American. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d love to. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d love to.\\nGeorge Will said there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a company in South Carolina that makes television. I said where are they? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to have a good name too by the way. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s important. You know, when somebody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s paying you a fortune for a hotel room, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nice to see a good name. Right? Do we agree?\\nWell, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a company in South Carolina but they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make them there; they assemble them. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll order parts that come in and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll assemble them. But much different.\\nBut I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d love it if we made them.\\nBut you take South Korea. We defend South Korea for essentially nothing. You have the maniac over in North Korea that nobody ever talks about by the way. Now, he really has nuclear weapons and we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk about him.\\nWe made the worst deal ever made with Iran. Right? The worst.\\nThese are the people that represent \\xe2\\x80\\x93 these people are incompetent. Or stupid. Somebody said, \"You shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say stupid. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not nice.\" But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re stupid. I think. I mean, I think. Unless I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know is there something going on that we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know about?\\nThink of it. Point after point, we lost. We lost everything. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve given them $150 billion. Hard to believe. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to develop \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I was telling somebody they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to develop nuclear weapon; they can buy it.\\nWhat the hell why should they develop it? They can buy it. And now all of a sudden they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going into Syria. They got so much money. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a terrorist state. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going into all of these different places. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re fighting them in Yemen and yet we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re making a deal with them.\\nSo why don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you say \"Hey, Yemen out\"? Our prisoners \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I want them back. I want them back. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want them over there. I want them back.\\nAnd all we have to do, very simple, is if you have the right messenger. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the right messenger. You know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gotten to a point where I have to be braggadocious. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s terrible. Right? Because I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be so nice and say \"We can all do a wonderful job\". People can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do those kind of stuff.\\nFor instance, the wall. I said, I guarantee you that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to build a wall. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be a real wall. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have people come through and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to come through legally. Or they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to come through with visas, which is a safe way, if we need it.\\nAnd we want people to come through. I want people to come through. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to say no.\\nBut we have at least 11 million \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, the scary thing is nobody has any idea how many. You know, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been hearing that number for years. You know, like 11 million. We have no idea. I spoke to one of the top people. They have no idea. Might be 5 million. Might also be 32 million. Could be 50 [million]\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\nBut we have to get them out. We have to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 look, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s harsh.\\nDwight Eisenhower \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we all like Dwight. Right? Remember the expression. Right?\\nI go remember he got elected \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"I like Ike\". How could he be bad? All right? And I think he was a nicer general than MacArthur and Patton. And I like Ike as a president but I love Patton and I love General MacArthur. I love them. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to find ourselves a Patton and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to find ourselves because we have a lot of smart guys in our military and women. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to find ourselves a Patton\\xe2\\x80\\xa6But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to find a Patton and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to find a MacArthur. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m really good at that. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to find great people.\\nAnd I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve told this story where I watched these generals go on television \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be on television. They shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be talking. You know? They shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be talking. They should be doing.\\nAnd they asked a certain general, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to insult him. It was like a month and a half ago. On a show. A talk show. I said here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s general so and so, one of the top, top, top people. I said what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s he doing on television? And he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s saying \"Well, ISIS is very tough. You know, they spread out.\"\\nBy the way, they took the oil that I said take. Remember I said \"Take the oil\"? Always take the oil! They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re being funded by the oil that I said take.\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want their damned oil. But you know what? It turned out to be another benefit of having it. Take the oil. And we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it.\\nWe shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have been in Iraq in the first place. And I said that in 2003. Shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have been there.\\nWe totally destabilized the Middle East. We totally blew it.\\nBut we were there. Then Obama announces because he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so predictable \"We are leaving on a certain date in a year.\"\\nRight? I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe. I was sitting there thinking \"Did he really say that?\"\\nHe said \"We will have all troops out by a certain date.\" Right? Did he say that?\\nI said \"No, no, tell me please.\"\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6Oh, you know what another one I got high marks on from every poll? Military. They think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be the best in the military because they say I \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, I always say I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. I will. But everybody knows that, especially God. Everybody knows that.\\nBut you know what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be the great at the military. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be so good. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll know when \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll build our military so strong, so tough, so incredible, nobody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to mess around. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re never going to have to use it. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re never going to have to use it.\\nAnd I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to take care of our vets. Believe me, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re our greatest people and our vets are not being treated as well as illegal immigrants. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to take care of our vets.\\nSo go back. So the world is unpredictable.\\nI made a business deal a year ago. And the guy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 oh, I beat him so badly. Aye, it was so beautiful. It was a beautiful thing. It was like a picture. For me, it was like a picture. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s my own problem. I guess. But to me it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like a painting when you could do something like that.\\nSo I made this deal and it was great. And they called. They did a story on me recently and it was a nice story. And I said, I hope they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t call this guy. They ended up calling this guy \"What do you think about Trump?\" And he said but in a respectful way, he said \"He won because he was so damn unpredictable. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what the hell he was going to do.\" That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a positive. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a positive.\\nI mean, if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a poker player and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re predictable, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going home with much money. Okay?\\nBut it was really \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I said, \"That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not nice what he said.\" First, I said \"That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not nice. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m unpredictable.\" Then I said, \"Wait a minute. He meant that as a compliment.\" And I called him. I said, \"What did you mean by that?\" He said \"I think that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the greatest compliment I can pay. We could not figure you out. You came at us from 15 different angles.\"\\nSo with Obama, when he announces that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leaving Iraq on a certain date, we shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have been there but once you announced the bad guys \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know how they say the surge worked? You know why the surge worked? You know why? Because the bad guys all moved back. They said, \"Hey, what do we have to get killed for?\" I mean, these people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind being killed, can you believe it? But they said \"If we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not.\" So they moved back.\\nAnd they said, \"Hey, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leaving in -\" What was the date? Do you remember the date? Specific date to the day. \"We will have all troops out. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a great president.\"\\nSo the bad guys, meaning the opponents, whatever you want to call them, they just said, \"Oh, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leaving in a year. Going to have all the troops out. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s go back. Why do we have to be shot at for the next year? And what do we have to do because if we do well maybe he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll change his mind and stay. So let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s let him think he has this great victory with the surge.\" Right? \"The surge worked!\"\\nWhat happened was that everybody pulled back. They said, \"Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wait.\"\\nNow we leave because of a lack of leadership. We leave and boom it comes apart. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what happened. That was the surge.\\nEverybody talk so much \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"Oh, the surge was so great.\" The surge was great because everybody knew \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they knew what was happening. They knew it was going to happen. They knew we were leaving even through Bush.\\nI mean, honestly, they knew we were leaving. They were fed up. So they pulled back and they said, \"Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s get them out.\" Everybody wanted to leave.\\nNow, I would have done it differently. Even if I wanted to leave and I might or I might not. I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even say.\\nPeople say, \"Mr. Trump, what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s your attitude on ISIS? When will you attack them? Where?\\nI say \"You know, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to talk \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I have a real chance of winning. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to tell you what my attitude. I want them to guess. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really want to tell you.\"\\nI mean, the one bad thing about our system, we have a system that got flaws. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face it. Hey, look at our leadership, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got flaws.\\nBut you know the one bad thing? When I gave that answer, they say \\xe2\\x80\\x93 although some people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I see it here \\xe2\\x80\\x93 some people say \"We love that. We love that.\" But when I give that answer, some people say \"Oh, Trump doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. He doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give an answer as to exactly what he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to do. Exactly what he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to do.\"\\nAnd I know exactly what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do and eventually after I was asked the question by 10 different reporters, all of whom are here tonight by the way, I said, \"You know, here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the problem. If I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give the answer, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to win because they write so incredibly negatively. So if I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give the answer, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to win.\" They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to say \"Trump wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t give us the answer.\"\\nThey don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unpredictability. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strategy.\\nAnd I said for a period of time like a month, I said \"I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to tell you because I actually have a chance because from the time I announced, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been on the top of the polls, almost at the top. You know, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing well.\"\\nIowa, will you get your numbers up please? Would you get these numbers up? I promise you I would do such a good job.\\nFirst of all, I am a great Christian and I am. I am. Remember that.\\nAnd I do well with the evangelicals. But the evangelicals left me down a little bit just last month. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what I did.\\nBut I am a great Christian. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a believer and I believe in the Bible. And I even brought my Bible a month ago to a group signed by my mother, Mary, and with the address and the date \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t tell you what date it was because possibly you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m younger than that. But she didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want anybody taking my Bible because that was very important to her.\\nSo cute. She has the address, has the date. But I said to myself, \"You know \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"\\nBy the way, before I forget, will you get the numbers up Iowa please? This is ridiculous. I mean, what is my competition? In all fairness, in all fairness, what is my competition?\\nDo you think these guys \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to say Carson \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to say Rubio, who really is way down \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I mean, I am second. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s terrible. But I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like being second. Second is terrible to me.\\nBut do you think that Ben is going to go to China? These guys are fierce. Like they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d come into your office. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made many deals with China. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had great victories in terms of deals with China. They come into your office. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no \"Hello. How are you? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a wonderful day.\" They come in \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"We want deal.\" There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no games. I do this for a living. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m really good at it, folks. Really good.\\nAnd you know, when you talk about energy, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you one thing, everybody agrees \\xe2\\x80\\x93 oh, do I have energy. Oh. I toss and turn thinking about how I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to make the best deal for you folks. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be tossing and turning. I will be tossing and turning. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have so many deals that is so good for you. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have numbers are going to be so good.\\nI always joke you may get tired of them but then I always take that back because nobody gets tired of winning.\\nWe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win anymore. You know, think about it. Do we win at all? Ever?\\nWe lose with the military. ISIS beats us. Everybody.\\nWe lose with trade.\\nWhen are we going to come back and say, \"We beat China\" on a deal? When are we going to come back, \"We beat Japan\"?\\nDo you know that everybody said \"Oh, Japan. They have so power over us. They have so much power because we owe them $1.5 trillion and they send all those cars.\"\\nThey have no power. If we ever say, \"Listen, if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to treat us fairly, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want your cars anymore\", they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d go out of business, folks, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re gone.\\nSame thing with China. China is not even doing that well. But they just lowered, they just devalued their currency. The biggest in two decades. And the reason they did it, they could never thought but we have so many other problems that they felt, \"Oh wow, we can get away with this and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to make it impossible.\"\\nDid you see the results yesterday of Caterpillar Tractor? Horrible. Because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not getting stuff out because everybody \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Japan and China in particular \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is devaluing their currency. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s their number one weapon. And the stupid trade deal that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re making doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even cover it. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s their number one weapon and the trade that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re making doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t cover it.\\nSo I only say this and you know what? People might say \"It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s terrible. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a terrible person, a terrible human being. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to vote for him anyways.\" Okay, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fine. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m actually a nice person.\\nI always say this \\xe2\\x80\\x93 nobody can do this stuff better than me. And I know all the guys I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m running against. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re wonderful people. Some of them I really like. But who cares?\\nI was talking to one of the candidates the other day. I was talking about corporate inversions and they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know what the hell I was talking. They had no idea. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not their thing.\\nAnd unless we stop all of the things that are going with other countries and unless we make great trade deals, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re being eaten alive.\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why when you look at the phony numbers, we have 100 million people in our workforce that aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t working. Our real unemployment rate is probably 30%. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not 5.3%. That was done for politicians so they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d look good. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not 5.3%. How can you have 5.3% when you have 100 million people?\\nYou look for a job. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a young guy, that handsome young guy with the red hair, right there\\xe2\\x80\\xa6but if he comes out and he goes into the workforce and he looks for a job and he goes through college and does well and then he can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get a job and when he gives up because at some point after months you give up, they essentially consider you employed. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the most ridiculous thing.\\nWe have a tremendous \\xe2\\x80\\x93 tens of millions of people in that position. They can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t find jobs. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re good people. They want to work. They can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not reflected in the real numbers because the politicians want to look good.\\nSo let me just before we talk some questions, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to talk about something I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never really talked about it onstage but we should talk about it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called Super PACs.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the great scams of all time. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the great scams.\\nSo we sent out \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I think I had \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not me. People set them up. And I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. Maybe they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re setting up for my benefit.\\nLet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s take me. A guy sees me, likes me, sets up a Super PAC. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk to him. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do anything.\\nI think we had either 9 or 5 or 11. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all over the place. Trump, Trump \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one of them called The Art of the Deal PAC after the book.\\nThey have all these PACs. And the money comes in. And what do they do with the money? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know.\\nAnd we aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t supposed to call them or anything. Okay.\\nSo, we wrote a letter \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a legal letter \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to I think either 9 or 11 last week saying we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want their money, send it back because again, what do they do with it? If some guy that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s having a hard time all of a sudden has $2 million sitting in a Super PAC, do you think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to take ads for Trump? Maybe and maybe not.\\nSo we sent them a \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a scam, Super PACs, a scam. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a disgrace that we have. A disgrace.\\nAnd I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you I read a number with, as an example, with Ben. Ben is paying 70 to almost 80 cents on the dollar to raise money. So when you read he has all this money, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s paying a lot of money and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not reflected yet. So when you hear they raised $20 million, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re paying \\xe2\\x80\\x93 now think of it, who pays \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the number I actually heard was 79 but you know these guys will check them so I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m telling you it may be off but you all know it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot.\\nI think they said, 79 cents on the dollar. Think of it. To raise the money, they take 79 cents before they get to use the money for what it was supposed to be. Somebody is making a fortune.\\nI know in Romney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign, a couple of guys walked away with millions and millions of dollars. Millions. They became rich raising money. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s better than being a real estate broker.\\nFor the people and real estate brokers, they take these massive percentages of the money they raise. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a scam. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a scam.\\nNow, in Ben\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case, his Super PAC is running Iowa. And let me tell you, the people that are running that Super PAC, even if it comes in small donations, those are the real bosses. Those are the bosses.\\nIn the case of Jeb Bush, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not supposed to deal with these Super PACs. Okay? So, it was in the Wall Street Journal the other day. He has a Super PAC fundraiser or something in a hotel and right next to it, he had his campaign ballroom. Did you read that? Two ballrooms. One here, one here, right next to each other by coincidence, of course. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not supposed to be coordination. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not supposed to be talking. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re right next to each other. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing compared to what some are doing.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a scam and it should be stopped. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unfair to somebody like me that is spending my own money.\\nAnd what happened and I haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talked about this before but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m seeing what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s horrible what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on. What happened is the last time they had the Super PACs, I actually think there was sort of a wall. You know, they called it the wall.\\nAnd this is a wall too. Won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be as good as the one I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to build but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a wall.\\nBut it was a wall and they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t deal.\\nI mean, even though like Bush has a friend of his running his Super PAC, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure they never talk. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure. What do you think the chances are that they talk? 100% or 99%? 100%. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d say 100%. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d say 100%. Only a foolish person would say 99%. But whatever.\\nThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not supposed to. But they put a friend in there. They put other people in there. They put whoever. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way it works.\\nAnd in some cases, I hear in Ben\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case, I hear in other cases, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re literally running.\\nI mean, had Walker done this in all fairness because he had money in the Super PAC but he had no money in his campaign and he was unable to figure out this is what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all doing. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s out of the race because he couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t figure it out.\\nThe whole thing with Super PACs is a horrible, horrible scam. So I sent letters last week to as many as we could find. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all over the place. We want you to close the Super PAC. We want nothing to do with it. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to get advertisements. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want any of the money. Go home and ideally give the money back. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even have to give the money back from what I understand. They can keep it. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll probably if they actually raised money for me, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say \"What a horrible thing he just said. I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to support somebody else.\" They could do that.\\nBut the Super PACs have total control over the people running for office. Total. Nothing over me. Nothing.\\nI feel it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very unfair. I feel it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very unfair situation.\\nNow, if they want, they could have full disclosure and everything\\xe2\\x80\\xa6But what are they doing with this whole thing?\\nAnd I think it makes dishonest people out of people that might be honest.\\nBut the Super PACs are controlling your candidates \\xe2\\x80\\x93 some more than others. Some are unbelievable.\\nAnd what the press should really do is take a look at how much money is left. When you read that Ben raised $1, how much is left after he pays all of the consultants and all of these people, how much is left to spend in the campaign. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be amazed. I mean, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so little.\\nBush, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the same thing.\\nAnd I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go over \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there are other names. I know every one of them. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a horrible thing that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s taking place.\\nAnd again, last cycle, at least they went through the motions. Now, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not even going through the motions. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not even going through.\\nAnd just remember when I have to negotiate with companies to keep them in this country so they build jobs here and they build their plants here and their factories here and they do all of the things here, when I have to do that, you know, John Deere, I paid them tens of millions of dollars. You can even check. I said to John Deere, \"I want an endorsement.\" I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll give me an endorsement. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you if they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not so smart. I guarantee no other person gave John Deere \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I mean, I bought probably more than $10 million worth of John Deere equipments. I love it. You know why? Iowa. Iowa. I love it. I love it.\\nWhen we can. By the way, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great company. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great company. But I buy a lot of stuff from John Deere because I have a lot of big developments that really require John Deere type equipment. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to buy it from them. I could buy it from others. But I want to steer it to them when I can.\\nBut we have to do something to clean up this political mess because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s crooked stuff. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s crooked stuff. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to stop.\\nAnd it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very unfair to people who go out and do it the way you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re supposed to do it, including me. I think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the only one that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s self-funding. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the only one putting up my own money, other than \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I know it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s precious \\xe2\\x80\\x93 people write in to DonaldJTrump.com or whatever and they send me checks like $20. I keep saying the woman for $7.50, $50, $100. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want their money. But if you send it back it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s totally insulting.\\nI mean, they always write letters too. They write these beautiful letters \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"Mr. Trump, I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t afford much and I know you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need it but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sending $50 because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so important what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re saying about the country.\" It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s beautiful.\\nI mean, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen such beautiful letters. And if I send it back, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no letter I can write that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to be insulting to those people, really. \"Dear Mr. So and So or Mrs. So and So, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need your money and thanks a lot but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do it ourselves.\" If I got that back, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d say \"Who the hell does he think he is?\"\\nSo we take that and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something that I think is important.\\nSo I always preface it by saying I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t consider that funding but I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m self-funding my campaign and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m getting ready to put up millions, millions.\\nAnd something I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very proud of that I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s you know really great, it hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t gotten very much publicity, hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t gotten much publicity, but I have spent less money than any other candidate. Okay? By far. I think. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know, probably a couple of guys that have nothing so they just go around\\xe2\\x80\\xa6But I was told that I spend less. And I have the best results because in most polls I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m number one.\\nNow, until Iowa came along, I said \"every poll\", and then Iowa \\xe2\\x80\\x93 what the hell are you people doing to me? You know? You know?\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m telling you. They said, \"Why don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you skip Iowa?\" They told me that. Everybody said \"Skip Iowa\". All of the political geniuses.\\nA man just interviewed me back there, great reporter. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actually a great reporter. Of course, if he writes a bad story, I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say that. But he is. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great reporter.\\nAnd he said, \"Would you ever think of maybe skipping Iowa going right to New Hampshire? And then you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d go to South Carolina\" where I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m leading by massive \\xe2\\x80\\x93 yeah, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to see the rallies there. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re incredible.\\n\"But you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d go to New Hampshire. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99d go to South Carolina. You go to Nevada. You go to the SCC.\"\\nI said I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that because I have such an unbelievable relationship with the people from Iowa that I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win. I really do. I believe it. I believe it.\\nAnd I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to skip Iowa. I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do well. I think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do great with evangelicals. I think a lot of things are going to come out over the next period of time that are not going to be so good for our opponents, honestly, and I think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do great with the evangelicals because I am the real deal. I will tell you that. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the real deal.\\nSo I told these political pros, you know, I hate to say it but the last long number of elections on the Republican circuit, the person that won Iowa did not get the nomination. Okay? I want to take away some of your muster. You understand that.\\nSo could we do \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and please do me a favor? Let me win Iowa. And then I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to win, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m telling you we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win New Hampshire, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win South Carolina.\\nA great poll just came out on North Carolina just a little while. A PPP poll. It was great. Some of you saw that. But great poll.\\nBut we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to go on and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win.\\nAnd actually, one of the pundits \\xe2\\x80\\x93 because you have some smart pundits and some very, very dumb pundits. A lot of pundits said \"He\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never run. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to run.\" They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re still trying to recover.\\nBut one of the very smart one says \"If Trump wins Iowa, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s over.\" It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interesting because it will go right through because everywhere else is so great.\\nAnd I thought it was good here. Come on. Okay, so that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the end of that.\\nBut I want to tell you, will you \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I refuse to say \"Get your asses in gear.\" I will not say that. I will not say it. I will not say it because I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to use anything that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s even a little bit off.\\nSo will you please do me a favor and work with my people and go out on Feb. 1stand vote and give us a victory?\\nAnd if I win Iowa, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to run the whole table and we are going to make such great deals and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have such a great military and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take care of our health care without that crazy Obamacare that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nightmare.\\nSo, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sticking with you people. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to spend money here. I have a great team over here. And I will tell you I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to spend a lot of time here and I really want to win Iowa and I think we should and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so important. And you know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about time that Iowa could have a victory and let that person go onto a total victory. Okay? Not like over the last \\xe2\\x80\\x93 right?\\nSo, I love you all. I mean, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re having fun. But I love you all. But I do mean it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to stay here. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to work really hard.\\nWhen I heard the poll today, they said \"What are you going to do?\" I said, \"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to work harder in Iowa.\" I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not leaving Iowa. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not leaving Iowa.\\nNow, if I lose Iowa, I will never speak to you people again. That I can tell you.\\nOkay, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s do a couple of questions. Right? Come on.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6You know, we have now and the numbers they just came out we have 50 million people in poverty in this country.\\nNow, you look like you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing pretty well in all fairness. But still, we have 50 million. We have 46 million people and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting food stamps. 46 million. Think of it. You know, we talk about how well we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing.\\nSo we have 50 million \\xe2\\x80\\x93 almost 50 million each between poverty, food stamps, and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to end.\\nOne of the problems \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have enough jobs in this country. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very simple. You know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so simple when you think about it.\\nOur jobs have been taken away.\\nAnd I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what else, middle income folks \\xe2\\x80\\x93 their salaries haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t gone up in 12 years. People are making less wages now than they were 12 years ago. And other things have gone up. So they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re really doing much worse than they were doing 12 years ago.\\nBut that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an amazing stat.\\nBut people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one of the reasons they say I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing so well because I let people know we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to bring jobs back. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to bring industry and plants. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to bring it all back and nobody else can say that. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to bring it back because a lot of the folks in this room are doing worse than they were 12 years ago and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re working.\\nThen the other thing, you have a lot of part-time jobs. I have some people that I know very well and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had a job for 20 years at the same place. All of a sudden they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re working part-time because of Obamacare because from an accounting standpoint, it just works better. They love the owners, the stores and things. They love the owners; they think the owners are great. But the owners are forced to make part-time jobs; they have part-time jobs. They work all their life. They have a wonderful company that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re working for, and now all of a sudden they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re cut into part-time jobs because of Obamacare because of the rulings of Obamacare. And you all know what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m talking about.\\nSo they end up being part-time workers and they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to be part-time workers. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even like the psychology of being called a part-time worker. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to have that stuff anymore. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to have it any more.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have real jobs and the numbers are going to go up. Believe me. The numbers are right now worse than 12 years ago and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a shame\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6Tell you what, as President, I can guarantee it. As Trump, I can say I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll probably be able to pull it off anyway because they know it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be easier to take Todd and just say, \"Look, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to work with you, Todd. Okay?\" So will you get me that number and everything and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll make sure that everything get \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and somebody else \\xe2\\x80\\x93 who else over here? You have problems with the VA also, huh? Terrible?\\nI hear only \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I just hear terrible. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to solve that problem. You know, it can be solved.\\nThe waits now for the VA are longer than they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever been\\xe2\\x80\\xa6The waits now are worse than they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever been. Thousands of people dying waiting for a doctor. Okay, dying.\\nAnd you find the same thing, you say. You have to use your own because they won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do anything.\\nSo we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take care of our vets and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take care of the VA and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be one of the things we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be releasing pretty soon.\\nBut one of the things we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do with the VA, we have a lot of hospitals that aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t doing any business. We have a lot of private doctors that could do more business.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re losing a lot of our doctors because of Obamacare. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re retiring. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leaving.\\nOne of them \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a friend of mine \\xe2\\x80\\x93 said \"I have more nurses working for me now more than before but I have more accountants\" and the end result is a disaster; he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s getting out of the business. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got nurses but he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got more accountants than he has nurses because the paperwork is so crazy.\\nSo one of the things we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do is if Todd or if you or if somebody has problems because of the wait \\xe2\\x80\\x93 because the waits are unbelievable \\xe2\\x80\\x93 5, 6, 7 days sometimes. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to a private doctor. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to go to a private hospital. Or a public hospital that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in the area. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to pay for that and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to cost less money \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to cost less money than the system we have now \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to end up getting much better care. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to cost less and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get better care\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\nSo the Keystone Pipeline, first of all, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d approve it because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thousands of jobs. Okay? I would approve it so fast, so fast.\\nAnd Hillary should have approved it.\\nYou know, Hillary wanted to approve it but she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been dragged so far left, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x93 forget it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a disaster.\\nSo I would approve it.\\nBut with that being said, I may want to make a better deal because you know what? We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re bringing oil from Canada. Right? I may say, I want 10%. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to approve it but I want 10%, 15%.\\nBecause the truth is that the Keystone Pipeline was better a while ago than it is now because we have so much because of new technology, we have so much energy underneath our own feet with the fracking and all of the other things that have emerged over the last five years, we have so much energy. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great stuff.\\nWe have really great quality, higher than Canada. You know, they have the tar sands, which is a problem for them. Very expensive to get it out.\\nWe have great stuff. So I would approve it because I love the jobs of building it. I love the jobs of building it.\\nBut I may just say, maybe we should get 10%, 15%, maybe 20% as that oil flows through our land. You know, maybe we should do that.\\nSo I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to look into that. But when I approve it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what, when I approve it, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be a great deal for the United States. It won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be like \\xe2\\x80\\x93 because right now, what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing is we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re approving it, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not really getting anything. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re putting it underground, and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actually good environmentally. Better than having trucks going down the road and everything else. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good environmentally. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not getting \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not getting \\xe2\\x80\\x93 anything much for it.\\nWhen I get finished with the Keystone, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be happy and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be happy. Okay?\\nWell, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you in all fairness, Ben Carson said yesterday or the other day that he wants to abolish Medicare. Okay? And you know what a disaster that is. Now, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sure at some point, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take it back. But he said he wants to abolish Medicare and one thing, people do like their Medicare; they do like it.\\nAnd you are bringing up a point that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard before. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to look at a lot of different things.\\nBut we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to save Social Security, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to save Medicare and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way it is. Okay? We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not abolishing like other people.\\n \\nOkay, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a lot of people but you know what? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s costing us $200 billion a year immigration in this country right now.\\nAnd Dwight Eisenhower is going to say he moved 1.5 million in the 1950s, early 1950s, moved them out.\\nWe have tremendous illegal immigration problems. Dwight Eisenhower, nice guy, he moved 1.5 million people out of the United States. And you know what happened? He moved them right across the border and they came back and they moved them again and they came back. They moved them a third time, they came right back.\\nAnd then you know they were tougher in those days. They moved them all the way south \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all the way south \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t come back.\\nNow, we have to do it. We have no choice. We either have a country or we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\nAnd I want them to come back. But I want them to come back with papers. I want them to come back legally. I want them to come back. The good ones. The good ones. But only the good ones.\\nWe got some bad ones. Remember the heat I took with illegal immigration? Remember that heat? For two weeks. Rush Limbaugh said \"He has received more incoming than any human being I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen.\" And then he double-downed\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\nYou know what? I took a lot of heat and then you had Kate in San Francisco, killed, shot in the back and so many others. And people started looking.\\nAnd let me tell you, we have some wonderful people over here and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re here illegally but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re wonderful people. Okay? And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll try to get them back real soon and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do it through a legal process.\\nBut we also have some really bad gang members. You know, some of the gangs in LA. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re made up of illegal immigrants.\\nAnd we have unbelievable police forces that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get the respect that they should get. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get it. I mean, what they go through, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unbelievable. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re afraid to talk to anybody. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to lose their jobs. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to lose their pensions. They can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk.\\nNow, let me just tell you something. You can always have bad apples. In this room, we have a couple of bad apples. Okay? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know who they are or where they are but you do. Probably mostly back there in the press.\\nBut the police do an unbelievable job. And they know the gangs. You go to LA the LA cops. You got Chicago, the Chicago cops. These people are amazing people if they would be allowed to do their jobs. But they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not allowed to do their jobs.\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get the bad ones out of here so fast and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not coming back and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to put them in our jails because I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to subsidize these various countries where they come from for the next 45 years. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want them in our jails. We have hundreds of thousands right now in our jails. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want them in our jails.\\nI heard a couple of these candidates saying, \"Well, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \" They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re such babies.\\nBut you know what? They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about putting them in jail. Well, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want them. Our jails are over-brimming. I want to use our jails for people that are supposed to be there. Okay? And I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to put these really bad dudes \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I mean, they are bad \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to have to pay for them for the next 45 years. Okay?\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to deal very humanely with the good people and they are mostly good people. But we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got some real bad ones and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re out of here. Your head will spin probably.\\nSomebody said the other day, \"What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the first thing you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do?\" Well, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to work immediately on repealing Obamacare.\\nYou know, the one good thing about executive orders? The one good thing? You know, Obama signed an executive order where everybody just come in. Come in.\\nWe have great border patrol people. I got to know them a couple of months ago when I went down to Texas to the border. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re great people. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not allowed to do their job. They stand there and watch people walk right in front of them smiling at them. They want to do their job; they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not allowed to.\\nSo the executive order that President Obama signed, the one good thing about an executive order, in the first minute in office, I will counter-sign and revoke those executive orders. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be revoked. The only good thing.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actually the only good thing about an executive order is that a new president can just do a signature and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the end of that.\\nSo we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to clean up our border. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make it fantastic. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be proud to be a country again and a lot of good things are going to happen.\\nWe will support Israel 1,000%.\\nIsrael feels so left alone and I know BiBi and a lot of my friends are from Israel and they feel so left out.\\nAnd so many people say, you know, I have so many Jewish friends where they say why did I support Obama? I think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the worst thing that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ever happened to Israel. And we will support Israel beyond anything they ever have before. Okay?\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an easy one. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the easiest question of the night!\\n \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6The wall is a big factor. 60%, 70%. The drugs are a great question.\\nWe are going to stop drugs.\\nLook, I told you before \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Mexico \\xe2\\x80\\x93 $45 to $50 billion. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not including the drugs. The drugs that are coming across the border are beyond belief.\\nDid you see the picture last week where they had a little wall this big and they built a ramp for trucks to go over it with trucks? Did you see the picture? They think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re playing games.\\nAnd Mexico is not helping us. Mexico is not helping.\\nDo you know if you want to become a citizen of Mexico \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I love the Mexican people. I have many Mexican people and Hispanics working for me. In Nevada, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m number one. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m rated number one in the polls with the Hispanics. Everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shocked.\\nBecause the Hispanics that are here legally, those people they want me, they know I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to bring jobs and everything else. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want people pouring in.\\nBut I will tell you Mexico has got to help us.\\nYou know, if you want to become a citizen of Mexico\\xe2\\x80\\xa6do you know it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the hardest countries in the world to become a citizen of? And yet, people pour right through into us, into us. They call us the dumb Americans. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what they call us because of our leaders. They call us the dumb Americans.\\nIf you want to become a citizen of Mexico, you could take the best person in this room, the most qualified, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to do it. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that.\\nAnd if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re there illegally and if you overstay your bound? You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to be there illegally. But if you have a pass for two weeks and you overstay your bound, they have cops waiting for you. They have police that say, \"You know you have one day left.\" I hear it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unbelievable. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m impressed actually. Because to a certain extent, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supposed to be.\\nBut if you want to become a citizen of Mexico, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impossible. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have anchor babies in Mexico. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re born a baby in Mexico, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like bye-bye.\\nHere, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re born over here, \"Oh, congratulations we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re taking care of the baby for 85 years.\" Not going to happen. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen. No, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen.\\nBy the way, this is important, I sort of lucked into this one. The 14th Amendment. It says right there \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, everybody says you have to go through a whole process, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take many years, you have to go through every state. You have to do another amendment. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrong. 14th Amendment covers it.\\nAnd some of the best legal minds in the world say \"Trump is right.\" I said, \"What? I am? I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know.\" I lucked into it. Every once in a while you luck.\\nThe fact is somebody comes in illegally and they have a baby, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not responsible. Now, we may have a court case but we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win it. And a simple act of Congress gets rid of it. And a lot of people didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that. Okay?\\nAnd the reason I said it can be possible because nobody could be foolish enough to allow a thing like that. How could it be possible? And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re one of the only countries where that takes place.\\nAnd honestly, I use Mexico as an example because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re so tough. If that happens in Mexico, they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know what you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about. What are you talking about? But with us? No good. Not going to happen anymore.\\n \\nWell, you know, the amazing thing is that the politicians in this country live by a whole different standard when it comes to health care, when it comes to everything they have including what you just said about Social Security.\\nOur politicians live by a different standard and I think that shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen. And some of them tried to do it.\\nYou know the story in Obamacare, they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to take it. They live by a different standard. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen. Everybody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to live by the same standard. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have the same standard as the poorest person in this room. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be.\\n \\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good question. But do you know if I answer that question, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have a big, big story. You know that, right?\\nYou know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you, it is a question that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s asked a lot.\\nI know a lot of good people. A couple of people on the stage that I really respect, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gotten to respect.\\nBut the truth is too early. I like to get things done first. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to close the deal. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to think about it.\\nThere are a lot of good people. There are a lot of good people. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to close the deal. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to get it done. And to get it done, I want Iowa.\\nSo good luck everybody. Thank you very much. I love you. I love you. Thank you. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be back. Thank you.\\nSo, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be discussing something so important for our country, for our economy, and for getting us all working again and working well again.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a tax reform that I think will make America strong and great again.\\nToo few Americans are working. Too many jobs are being shipped overseas. And too many middle income families cannot make ends meet.\\nThis plan directly meets these challenges and the challenges also of business.\\nIt will provide major tax relief for middle income and for most other Americans. There will be a major tax reduction.\\nIt will simplify the tax code. It will grow the American economy at a level it hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen for decades.\\nAnd all of this does not add to our debt or our deficit.\\nBut I will also be discussing some of that at the end because we have to make much better deals, we have to negotiate much harder, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to make our economy strong.\\nChanges for individuals will be at levels that you haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen in a long time.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to cut the individual rates from 7 brackets to 4. Simplification. 25%, 20%, 10%, and 0%.\\nIf you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re single and earn less than $25,000 per year or married and jointly earn less than $50,000 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so, very important. If you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re single and earn less than $25,000 or married and jointly earn less than $50,000, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll not pay any income tax \\xe2\\x80\\x93 nothing.\\nThis eliminates very strongly and quickly the marriage penalty. Very unfair penalty.\\nIt eliminates the AMT, which is the alternative minimum tax.\\nIt ends the death tax. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a double taxation. A lot of families go through hell over the death tax.\\nIt reduces or eliminates most of the deductions and loopholes available to special interests or to the very rich \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in other words, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to cost me a fortune, which is actually true \\xe2\\x80\\x93 while preserving charitable giving and mortagage interest deductions. Very importantly.\\nIt ends the current tax treatment of carried interest. Those are the hedge fund folks that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been talking about for quite a while. They make a lot of money. Carried interest.\\nSo it ends the current tax treatment of carried interest through speculative partnerships that do not grow businesses or create jobs and are not risking their own capital.\\nChanges for business \\xe2\\x80\\x93 now, so important, because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all about business. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all about jobs.\\nWe have 93 million people in this country that are in serious trouble, that want to work; they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work.\\nSo for business, no business of any size from a Fortune 500 company to a mom and pop shop to a freelancer living from gig to gig will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes. Big reduction.\\nA one-time deemed repatriation of corporate cash held overseas at significantly discount which coming back at a significantly discount \\xe2\\x80\\x93 10%. So it comes back discounted at a 10% tax rate and ends the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad.\\nNow, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called corporate inversion. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a huge subject.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been watching politicians now for years \\xe2\\x80\\x93 all talk, no action politicians. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been watching them for years talking about bringing this money back.\\nThe number is probably $2.5 trillion.\\nEverybody agrees it should come back \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Republicans, Democrats, everybody.\\nThey can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make a deal. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how to go about making a deal.\\nThe reason companies aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bringing it back is the tax is onerous. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make sense to bring it back.\\nAnd in fact, many companies are leaving the United States. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leaving our shores to go and collect their money.\\nThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going actually moving out of the United States for two reasons \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the taxes are too high and because they have tremendous amounts of money that they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bring back into this country when everybody wants them to bring it back in.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called leadership.\\nWe will have that money brought back in.\\nAs an example, I have millions of dollars overseas. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bring it back into this country. We filed papers. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been doing this for a year and a half. We can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get it back in.\\nSo the money stays in other countries and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what happens. Not good for us.\\nThe level of leadership that we need to get things like this done is so important. But this is something \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been watching it for a long time \\xe2\\x80\\x93 everybody agrees to.\\nWe also reduce or eliminate some business loopholes \\xe2\\x80\\x93 many of them actually \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and deductions made unnecessary or redundant by the new lower tax rate on business income.\\nThe tax rate now is so low that a lot of these deductions which are complicated, which don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make sense, and which are unfair are gone.\\nAnd we phase in a reasonable cap on the deductability of the business interest expense.\\nSo we are going to give you \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we have a very complex set of papers that actually if you know business is not so complex. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to hand them out right now to the press.\\nAnd I think you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see we have an amazing code. It will be simple. It will be easy. It will be fair.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s graduated. As you get up in income, you pay a little more.\\nSome of the very unfair deductions that certain people have been given who make a lot of money will not be available any longer.\\nBut I actually believe they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do better because I think the economy will grow. It will grow rapidly. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have something very special.\\nNow, with all of that being said and before we take some questions, we have to cut the costs of what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on in this country.\\nIf you look at what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing and the money we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re spending. I read where a washer \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know what a washer is? Nuts, bolts, and washer \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to send from one state to another, it was a 19 set washer and it cost $900,000 and some odd dollars to send it from here to there.\\nAnd there are many examples. Hammers that cost $800 that you can buy in the store for a tiny amount of money.\\nWe will run this country properly. There is so much money to be saved.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re reducing taxes but at the same time if I win, if I become President, we will be able to cut so much money and have a better country.\\nWe won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be losing anything other than we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be balancing budgets and getting them where they should be.\\nSo, this is a plan that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s simple, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a major reduction. I think people are going to be very happy. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve already had some very good reviews.\\nI did the plan with some of the leading scholars and economists and tax experts that there are in this country. They love it; they say \"Why hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t this been done before?\"\\nAnd this is my wheelhouse. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I do well.\\nThe economy is what I do well. Whenever they do polls, I always come out way above everybody else on the economy and on leadership, by the way, but I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say that.\\nSo, if anybody has \\xe2\\x80\\x93 [applause] \\xe2\\x80\\x93 thank you. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amazing. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s some of the press was actually clapping. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never saw \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen that before.\\nAll right. Why don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t we take some questions from the press?\\n \\nNo, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to do that yet but we have their approval. But we have some of the top people in the country worked on this.\\n \\nWell, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking at a 3% but we think it can be 5%, it could even be 6%. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have growth that will be tremendous.\\nAnd by the way, if we have more than 3%, these numbers are really spectacular.\\nAnd one of the things that they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take into account in any big league fashion is the cutting. There is so much waste in government and I believe when I get in there I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be able to cut without losing anything to cut tremendous amounts off of the \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not even showing anything for that.\\nSo, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re very conservative numbers.\\n \\nMy taxes will \\xe2\\x80\\x93 first of all, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have a much simpler tax statement. It will be much simpler.\\nWhen I do my return, it will be much \\xe2\\x80\\x93 my return go up to the ceiling and beyond, which is ridiculous. And you spend millions of dollars at a high level on lawyers, accountants, and everything else.\\nWe want to simplify them to a tremendous level.\\nThe bracket of 25% \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the big difference is many of the loopholes and many of the deductions which are all \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been there for years \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are antiquated in many cases.\\nOr are put there because a lot of the people that get these deductions are contributed to Hillary, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re contributing to Bush. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re contributing to every candidate but Trump. Because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not taking any money. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m self-funding. And these people want these deductions.\\nThere will be people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re reducing taxes. But believe me, there will be people in the very upper eschelons that won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be thrilled with this.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re taking away deductions and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the reasons we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re able to lower it.\\n \\nThis is actually a tax reduction. A big tax reduction, including for the upper income.\\nI believe that the economy will do so well that even though they won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be getting certain deductions which aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t fair for them to be getting that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll end up doing better.\\n \\nI just think this is a common sense approach. You know, we could say supply side. You could say there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 15 different names given out for different kinds of deductions or increases. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supply side or anything else.\\nI think this is a common sense, well thought out tax proposal that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to trigger the economy, going to make everybody go back and really want to work.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to create tremendous numbers of jobs.\\nOne of the other things that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m coupling this with is if I become President, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to renegotiate our trade deals. Because our trade deals are not sustainable by this country. Not sustainable.\\nWe cannot continue to let our jobs go to all of the different countries. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a country that we negotiate with that doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make a better deal. Everybody.\\nWe lose money with everything.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m also going to renegotiate some of our military costs. Because we protect South Korea, we protect Germany, we protect some of the wealthiest countries in the world \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Saudi Arabia \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we protect everybody. We protect everybody.\\nAnd we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get reimbursement. We lose on everything. We lose on everything.\\nSo, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to negotiate and renegotiate trade deals, military deals, many other deals that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to get the costs down for running our country very significantly. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not showing a big number in that. But I believe that if I become President, those numbers are going to be massive.\\nAs an example, Saudi Arabia. They make $1 billion a day. We protect them.\\nSo we need help.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re losing a tremendous amount of money on a yearly basis and we owe $19 trillion.\\nI used to say $18 trillion for the last 6, 7 months; now it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s $19 trillion and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only going up.\\n \\nWell, no, look. Senator [Marco] Rubio is a lightweight. We understand that. He wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be able to do this. He wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know a trade deal from any other deal and what certain people are trying to do is they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re trying to take \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we just went up in the last poll. We went up two points in the last poll, and we continue to go up.\\nIn the NBC poll, I think we went from 26% to 29%. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going up very strongly in the polls. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what to do about it.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve built a great company. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see that in 60 Minutes last night. I built a great company. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a phenomenal company with very little debt, tremendous cash flow.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m funding my own campaign.\\nGuys like Rubio, I mean, he desperately needs money. Ask the car dealer in Florida. Ask the people that support him.\\nAnd a guy like Rubio and others \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to single him out; you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re singling him out \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re largely controlled by their donors, the special interests, and frankly more than anybody else, the lobbyists.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve turned down millions of millions of dollars from lobbyists and special interests because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the right thing. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just not right. And that seems to be resonating very strongly.\\n \\nI negotiate. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. I get bills from people; I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll negotiate. Oh, is that a bad thing? The country should do that.\\n \\nYeah, I would. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d bring that same attitude to the White House. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true.\\nShe says I have a habit when you get a bill, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d call up and you negotiate. To me, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a compliment.\\nNo, I want to take that thinking to the White House. I would bet you we could save 20% of our budget. I could even save more. But we could save a tremendous amount.\\nThat has to be the attitude our country has. You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t spend millions and millions of dollars on doing something that you can do for $2,000.\\nYou know, when you look at costs, we just spent $1 million building a soccer field. Okay? A soccer field for our prisoners that happen to be in Guantanamo. Okay? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like that. What do you need $1 million for? Level out the surface, let them play \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if they had to play at all. Okay? What do you need to spend $1 million.\\nWe just spent \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a story today. $1 million on a soccer field. How do you spend $1 million doing a soccer field? You have a level piece of land. Throw them a ball if they have to play soccer \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if they have to play at all. Why are they playing soccer is my question.\\n \\nNo, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too long. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have time. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have time.\\n \\nNo, not at all. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re lowering taxes, which Republicans love.\\nAnd I think one of the reasons I am doing so well in the polls and one of the reasons I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing so well when it comes to the economy in all polls is that this is the thinking.\\nNo, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re lowering taxes very substantially. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re simplifying. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting rid of deductions that are actually obselete that certain people want to keep for certain reasons.\\nSo, no, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not true.\\n \\nWell, Putin was interviewed and I was interviewed last night. I thought his interview \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I though Charlie Rose did an excellent job. But I thought his was a softer interview.\\nScott Pelley interviewed me. I thought Scott was terrific. I mean, it was a tough interview but I thought he was very fair and I thought the piece was very good.\\n \\nWhy is he harder on me than Putin? I would say because Putin is a nicer person than I am.\\n \\nThe worst in 36 years. Well, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a good question and you can connect the dots. But I guess it has been probably since \\xe2\\x80\\x9904. You know, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about 10, 11, 12 years that people have wanted to bring the money back into the country.\\nAnd again it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called corporate inversion and in a lot of time corporations are moving out and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to other countries, taking jobs.\\nAnd now, we have a really big problem because we have serious companies \\xe2\\x80\\x93 very large, very prestigious companies as you know \\xe2\\x80\\x93 obviously you know something about business. But we have major companies looking to move out of the United States.\\nYou know, it used to be they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d move from New York to Florida. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99d move from New Jersey to Texas. Or whatever.\\nNow, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about moving from the United States to Ireland and to England and to other places, to Spain where they get treated differently and frankly better.\\nAnd they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing that for a number of reasons but one of the reasons \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one of the big reasons \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as you know is taxes. One of the other reasons is to get all of this cash that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve built up and they can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get back into our country.\\nAnd when this money comes back into our country that everybody wants, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be put to work in our country, largely. It can go other places. But largely.\\nAnd I think it will be an amazing boon.\\nNow, here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the other thing. They think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s $2.5 trillion. I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s much more than that.\\nI actually think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be more money than that. And boy if it is, we have hit pay dirt.\\n \\nWell, you know when you end the repatriation, when you get the money coming back in beyond, tremendous things happen.\\n \\nWell, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be announcing that in the not too distant future.\\nBut I will tell you. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been honest. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the only one that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s honest about this thing.\\nI watched Romney. I watched all \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"Oh, I pay so much tax. I pay so much tax.\" I watched all politicians and they say \"I pay \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"\\nI fight like hell to pay as little as possible. Can I say that? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not a politician.\\nI fight like hell always because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an expense.\\nAnd you know, I feel \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I fight. I have the best lawyers and the best accountants and I fight. And I pay. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an expense.\\nAnd frankly, I would feel differently if this country was spending the money wisely instead of throwing it out the drain.\\nOur country spends our money so stupidly and I will tell you that I could speak for myself I pay a lot of tax but I fight like hell to make it as low as possible. But I would feel a lot differently if our leadership was such that I respected the decisions.\\nAll you have to do is look at a list of the things that our government is spending money on right now and you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel so good about our country.\\n \\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what in terms of income inequality, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to create a lot of jobs.\\nYou know, right now, we have a false \\xe2\\x80\\x93 5.4%, 5.3%, 5.6% \\xe2\\x80\\x93 every month it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s different.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s such a phony number. Because when people look and look and look and then they give up looking for a job, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re taken off the roll. So the number isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t reflective.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen numbers of 24%. I actually saw a number of 42% unemployment. 42%.\\nAnd it could be because when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for a job and you go around and you look and you look and you find it, you want to work and you want to take care of your family and then you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get the job \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m talking about because you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re shaking your head \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get the job, essentially for statistically purposes you are considered employed.\\nSo then I read every time it comes out I hear 5.3% unemployment. That is the biggest joke there is in this country.\\nThat number is so false.\\nAnd you know, people ask \"How come Trump is doing so well? And Carson and others? How come they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing -?\" You know why they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing well? Because people are tired of political speak. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re tired of that.\\nAnd the worst example of it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one of the worst example of it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is the phony unemployment rate.\\nThe unemployment rate is probably 20%. But I will tell you you have some great economists that will tell you it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 30%, 32%. And the highest I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard so far is 42%.\\nThere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anger out there at the job picture.\\nNow, one of the things \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with that being said, China, Japan, Mexico, Brazil, these countries are all taking our jobs like we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a bunch of babies.\\nThat will stop. People will treat us fairly if I become President.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re losing our jobs. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re losing our base. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re losing our manufacturing.\\nAll of that will stop.\\n \\nWell, this is number one a simplification. Number two, what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m really doing is the big picture because corporations now are going to start having an incentive to create jobs. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have an incentive also to stay in this country.\\n \\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6Well, if they provide bigger dividends, people are going to have more money to spend. So that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not so bad either.\\nIf a corporation gives out a bigger dividend, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great. Mr. Jones gets a bigger dividend, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to have more money to spend in the economy. So that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good.\\n \\nI know nothing about that.\\n \\nNo, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not a populist. No, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a man of great common sense. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a man that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s built a tremendous company with the best locations in real estate, the best everything. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re here at one of them. I have many of these.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done a great job. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve employed tens of thousands of people. I employ now thousands and thousands of people. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done a good job.\\nBut I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say populist at all. I would say I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a man of common sense.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m cutting taxes. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to create a lot of jobs. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to get rid of a tremendous amount of waste.\\nAnd I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you what. The waste that I get rid of \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the waste that I get rid of \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is going to have a huge impact and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not even putting that in my numbers so I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be terrific.\\n \\nYes, the motor industry. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a beautiful way of describing it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the motor industry.\\nWhere are you from? England? I love them. Oh, what a beautiful accent.\\nNo, I want to get the industry \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we call it the automobile industry.\\nBut I want to get the automobile industry to build factories here.\\nAs you know, Ford is building $2.5 billion factory in Mexico.\\nMexico also took a big plant out of Tennessee and Tennessee thought they were going to get it and they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\nI want the motor companies, as you would say, or the automobile companies to build their plants in the United States.\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want Nabisco leaving for Mexico or any place else.\\nI want these companies not to leave Chicago, not to leave Michigan, not to leave New Hampshire and Iowa and South Carolina and all of these places where they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leaving and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to other countries.\\nI want them to stay here and they will stay here and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be so happy.\\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you very much. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been a great honor. Thank you.\\nAutism has become an epidemic.\\n25 years ago, 35 years ago, you look at the statistics. Not even close.\\nIt has gotten totally out of control.\\nI am totally in favor of vaccines but I want smaller doses over a longer period of time.\\nBecause you take a baby in \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen it and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen it and I had my children taken care of over a long period of time, over a two or three year period of time, same exact amount. But you take this little beautiful baby and you pump \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I mean, it looks just like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s meant for a horse not for a child.\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had so many instances \\xe2\\x80\\x93 people that work for me just the other day \\xe2\\x80\\x93 two years old, two and a half years old, a child \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a beautiful child \\xe2\\x80\\x93 went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.\\nI only say \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in favor of vaccines. Do them over a longer period of time. Same amount but just in little sections.\\nAnd I think you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I think you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to see a big impact on autism.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6Boy, oh, boy. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expect that. You know, Joe [Arends] and the group [Veterans for a Strong America] called and they said \"Would you come over and speak?\"\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m here for a certain reason. You know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called tomorrow night. So I got here and they asked a couple of days ago if it would possible to come over and say a few words. An endorsement from your group with so many veterans \\xe2\\x80\\x93 hundreds of thousands of veterans \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I really appreciate that, Joe. I did not expect that.\\nI didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expect it. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ask for it.\\nI will say this: I am with the veterans 100%. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re our greatest people. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re being treated terribly.\\nNot only the number of deaths, which are obviously \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on is incredible.\\nBut as of two weeks ago on Wednesday, the vets had the longest wait in the history of the Veterans Administration. You go in to see a doctor, you wait for days, for days.\\nAnd it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen. Not going to happen. If I win, believe me, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen.\\nAnd one of the things I thought I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d do and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d stress so strongly \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the veterans hospitals \\xe2\\x80\\x93 obviously they have problems. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not properly run.\\nAnd when you have to wait long hours and long days and then in some cases have the doctor say \"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sorry. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going on vacation\", believe me, it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get much worse than that.\\nSo we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to create a whole new system. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take this system apart.\\nAnd if they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not doing the job, the veterans are going to go to private doctors, private hospitals, public hospitals, and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to reimburse those doctors and those hospitals.\\nAnd you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get the greatest service of any veterans in any country because you deserve it. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be broken down into something that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be very special.\\nRight now \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and you know it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we have illegal immigrants that are treated better by far than our veterans. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen anymore. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen.\\nSo, Joe, I just really appreciate it. So unexpected.\\nTo be here is an honor. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t build ships like this anymore, folks. You know? We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do them this way anymore.\\nI actually said what about recommissioning \\xe2\\x80\\x93 look at this thing. The largest guns in the world. The most powerful guns. I learned about the Iowa.\\nBy the way, Iowa is a great place for a lot of reasons. You know? We have been treated so well in the state of Iowa. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been incredible. Number one on the polls and we love those people. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re great.\\nSo this is a great ship and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great state.\\nI just want to say that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to come out with some plans in a very short time.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be building up our military. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make our military so big and so strong and so great.\\nAnd it will be so powerful that I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to ever have to use it. Nobody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to mess with us. That I can tell you.\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have a President who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s respected by Putin, who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s respected by Iran.\\nYou know, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talk about for two seconds, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s talk about the Iran deal.\\nNow, Obama and his people call him the Supreme Leader of Iran. Obama talks about the Supreme Leader. Well, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not calling him a Supreme Leader.\\nBut he said the other day that after this rip-off deal is completed, he will never touch, do business with the United States again. \"We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re finished with the United States.\"\\nThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re taking $150 billion. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re getting a deal that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to go right into nuclear weapons much sooner than you think.\\nThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to self-police \\xe2\\x80\\x93 think about that one \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they are going to go and self-police.\\nThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got the 24-day \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they have 24-day provisions. And by the way, what people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the 24-day provision doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t start \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know this, right? It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t start for a long time before you even get to it. The clock is ticking. It can take forever. We may never get it there.\\nIt is one of the dumbest deals and one of the weakest contracts I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen of any kind.\\nSo, we are going to do things and this country right.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to sign deals where we have four prisoners over there and there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still there and we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even ask for them.\\nOne of them is there because he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a Christian. We have a writer. We have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the whole thing is absolutely insane.\\nYou know, they asked the President, and they asked Secretary of State Kerry who maybe \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been saying Hillary Clinton is the worst Secretary of State in the history of this country. Right? All right. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been saying it. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the world blew up around her. It blew up. Just blew up. The whole world is like a different place.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible that because of this deal made by Secretary Kerry who has absolutely no clue how to negotiate, it may that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to supersede. And I understand that he may want to run for President. He has no chance like she has no chance.\\nSo we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to see what happens.\\nWe have many problems in our country. One of them is immigration.\\nNow, I took a tremendous hit when I brought up illegal immigration when I announced I was running for President.\\nAnd for two weeks, I said \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, Rush Limbaugh \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great guy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he said \"He has suffered more incoming\" \\xe2\\x80\\x93 meaning the press \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"than anybody I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen.\"\\nSo what happened is you have now found out what illegal immigration is all about and I am so happy that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the one that brought it to the fore because believe me, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a big problem. It is a big problem.\\nSo you remember for about two weeks, I said, \"Boy this is tougher than I thought running for President.\" And then you found out there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tremendous crime. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tremendous drugs pouring across the border. Tremendous. Beyond. Going to Chicago, going to New York, going to LA, going all over our country.\\nSo the drugs pour in and the money pours out. Not a good deal. We get the drugs, they get the money. The drug cartels are going wild. They cannot believe how stupid our government is.\\nThey are making a fortune. The drugs come in. The money goes out daily. And I saw it because I was on the border. I was there. And we saw it. And everybody sees it everyday.\\nAnd we have the kind of people that can do something about it but we have no leadership. None. None whatsoever.\\nSo, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to build a wall and Mexico\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to pay for the wall, believe me. You know, a lot of politicians have said \"Oh, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to pay\". They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know anything about \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they never read the Art of the Deal, first of all.\\nSo here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the story. So here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the story. I said the other day to one of my people \"What is the United State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trade deficit with Mexico, Japan, and China?\"\\nSo let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s start with China. Almost $400 billion a year.\\nNow, if you have a company where you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re losing $400 billion, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to do something very fast.\\nWe don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year frankly for decades.\\nNot going to happen anymore. Not going to happen anymore.\\nWith Japan where their massive ships floating right here and they drop off the cars, right? They drop off thousands and thousands and thousands of cars \\xe2\\x80\\x93 millions of cars \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and we sell them beef. We sell them beef.\\nAnd they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want it because their farmers don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want our beef. They protest and they send it back. All right?\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen that way anymore.\\nNow, with Mexico \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I love Mexico. I have many, many people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 many, many people from Mexico that work with me and they work for me and they buy my apartments.\\nSame with China. I have so many people. They pay me millions and millions. What am I supposed to hate China because they gave me millions of dollars to buy an apartment? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think so.\\nI had the largest bank in the world as a tenant. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s from China. Bigger than any bank in this country by many times. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re from China.\\nThe problem that we have is that the leaders of Mexico, Japan, and China and every other country that we do business with, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re smarter, more cunning, sharper than our leaders.\\nI love free trade. The concept is great. But you need smart people.\\nI have the smartest people in this country lined up. I know the smartest.\\nI have Carl Icahn. I have the best business leaders and they all want to do it. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re wealthy because they make good deals like me. I make good deals.\\nYou know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a talent. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a talent. You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be a politician.\\nLook, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m fighting some very nice people. Very nice. Even though I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m leading in the polls. But they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re very nice people.\\nBut they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re never going to do anything with these countries. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re never going to be able to do it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an instinct. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s special. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have it. Believe me, they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have it.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just going to be more of the same.\\nSo, we are going to make our country so great.\\nWe are going to make it strong. We are going to make it powerful.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to rebuild the military. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make it so strong.\\nWe are going to take care of our veterans.\\nAnd in the end, in the end, I want you people to look around and look at each other because this is going to be a special day.\\nThe other week \\xe2\\x80\\x93 two weeks ago in Mobile, Alabama, 31,000 people showed up in a rainy rough day. 31,000 people came to see us speak and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about making America great again.\\nLast night in Dallas at the American Airlines Center, 20,000 people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the basketball arena of the Mavericks. 20,000 people showed up and I want to tell you, it was a love fest. Everybody \\xe2\\x80\\x93 think of it, 20,000 people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t one heckler in the whole room. I kept saying, \"There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got to be one.\"\\nThere was a word \\xe2\\x80\\x93 two words that used to be used a lot called \"silent majority\". They stopped using them.\\nThe silent majority, believe me, is back and I think we can use it somewhat different.\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think we have to call it a silent majority anymore because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not silent. People are not silent.\\nThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re disgusted with our incompetent politicians.\\nThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re disgusted with the people that are giving our country away.\\nThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re disgusted when they tell the border patrol agents who are good people and can do the job.\\nThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re disgusted when they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re allowed people to just walk right in front of them and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re standing there helpless and people just pour into the country.\\nThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re disgusted when a woman who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nine months pregnant, walks across the border, has a baby, and you have to take care of that baby for the next 85 years.\\nThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re disgusted by what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening to our country.\\nAnd you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to look around and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to remember who the people are that are here because we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing something special. This is a movement. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make our country great again.\\nBelieve me, we will make our country great again.\\nI love you all. Thank you very much.\\nThank you very much, everybody. Thank you all for being here. This is some turnout. My great honor.\\nThe Chairman just left as you probably know and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been extremely fair. The RNC has been absolutely terrific over the last two month period.\\nAnd as you know, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve wanted. I wanted fairness.\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to be treated any differently than anybody else. I just wanted fairness from the Republican Party.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leading in every single poll. A new poll came out today where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re over 30%. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve actually hit numbers as high as 35% and 40%.\\nAnd frankly, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve felt that the absolute best way to win and to beat the Democrats and very easily I think beat the Democrats no matter who it may be whether it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Hillary or anybody else and I think maybe Hillary is going to have a very hard time frankly with what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening getting to the starting gate, the best way for the Republicans to win is if I win the nomination and go directly against whoever they happen to put up.\\nAnd for that reason, I have signed the pledge.\\nSo I will be totally pledging my allegiance to the Republican Party and the conservative principles for which it stands and we will go out and we will fight hard and we will win. We will win.\\nAnd most importantly, we will make our country great again because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all about. We have to make our country great again.\\nThis is a self-funded campaign. We have our heart in it. We have our soul in it. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need money and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want money.\\nAnd this is going to be a campaign like I think no other.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not controlled by lobbyists. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not controlled by anybody. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m controlled by the people of the country in order to make our country great again.\\nYeah, I got nothing. I really got nothing.\\nThe question was what did I get for signing the pledge? Absolutely nothing. Other than the assurance that I would be treated fairly. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen that over the last two months. They really have been very fair.\\nNo, I have no intention of changing my mind.\\nWell, I think the big thing that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s changed is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been obvious to all \\xe2\\x80\\x93 number one, after I announced, we went up like a rocket ship.\\nNobody thought I was going to run and they said \"Oh, he won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t run and he won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t put in his papers. And he wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do all of this.\"\\nI did that. The papers in terms of the company turned out to be spectacular. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great company. I built a great company. And all of the other papers have turned out to be very well received.\\nAnd I think the thing that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s changed is the fact that I went to number one place very quickly after I signed and after I in this building notified everybody that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d be running for President.\\nSo I think the biggest thing is that I went early to number one and the RNC has treated me with great respect.\\nSo that was very important.\\nNo, I see no circumstances under which I would tear up that pledge.\\nWell, you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to be met when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re at 2%. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of those things. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way life works. And I like Gov. [Chris] Christie, by the way.\\nWell, the Chairman asked if he could come up. You saw him. He was here a little while ago. And I was greatly honored that he did come up frankly.\\nWell, I think that when you get right down to it, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a nation that speaks English and I think that while we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in this nation, we should be speaking English. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how assimilation takes. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I mean, whether people like it or not that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how we assimilate and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how we go on to that next phase and that next stage.\\nAnd that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how people that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t speak \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not just talking about Spanish; I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m talking about from various parts of the world \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how they will become successful and do great.\\nSo I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more appropriate to be speaking English.\\nWell, one of the things I want to do and I feel very strongly it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a country based on borders and our country is based on laws.\\nAnd when people come into the country illegally, we should not allow that.\\nAnd this is not from South America. This is not from Mexico. This is from all over the world.\\nWhen people come illegally, we cannot allow that.\\nAnd I want people to come legally. I want very much to take care of our border because our southern border is a total mess. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been proven.\\nAnd interestingly, a couple of months ago when I announced, I made some very strong statements about the crime and the problems that were happening and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been proven right.\\nAnd many of the people in this audience actually have apologized to me, which I very much appreciate. Of course, they haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t done it publicly but these are minor details but someday they will.\\nThe fact is that we are a nation that wants and needs borders. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a nation that wants and needs and is based on laws.\\nAnd we will make sure that that takes place.\\nWith that being said, I want people to come into our country legally. I want to have a big, fat beautiful open door. I want people of great talent to come in for Silicon Valley. I want engineers. I want physicists. I want people with great talent to come into the United States.\\nWhen people graduate from college, you can be number one in your class at Harvard or number one at Yale or the Wharton School of Finance or Princeton or Stanford. And immediately if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not a citizen of the United States, you get thrown out of the country. We want those people to stay.\\nWe want people of great talent to be in the United States to work here and ultimately to become a citizen.\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know enough about it to comment on it. Was she jailed? I really don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know much about it.\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s absolutely false. I win at golf. I win at golf. That I can tell you.\\nWell, I understand how the system works maybe better than anybody. I understand the political system and I understand also very much a system for coming in for illegal immigrants.\\nDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget if I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bring up the subject of illegal immigration, you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be asking the question. Nobody would be even talking about immigration. And immigration and in particular illegal immigration has become a very big factor.\\nNow, a lot of bad things have happened with respect to crime since I brought it up.\\nBut if I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bring it up, immigration would not even be a subject that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re talking about and it happens to be a very important subject.\\nI have to say this: It can also be a very positive subject because I believe so strongly in immigration and I just \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we have to stop illegal immigration and we have to look forward to great immigration done in a legal manner.\\nBut if I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bring it up, nobody would be talking about it.\\nWell, there is gridlock in Congress right now and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no leadership at the top. You have to be able to lead. You have to be able to get people into your office. You have to get people go to them. Any way you want to do it. But you have to be able to lead. There is no leadership at the top.\\nSigning executive orders it not the way our country was supposed to be run.\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to talk about that. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inappropriate.\\nTom Brady? Well, Tom Brady is a very good friend of mine. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great guy.\\nFor those of you who don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know him, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very honorable and an honest guy and a truly great athlete. He is really a very good friend of mine.\\nAnd I just spoke to him a little while ago. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so thrilled and so happy.\\nTom Brady \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I think what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done is terrible. And he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been exonerated as I understand it because I just heard about it. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very happy for Tom.\\nAs far as the Commissioner is concerned, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re having a rough year. Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face it. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re having a very rough year.\\nWell, in Europe they have tremendous problems with people going in and storming. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a huge humanitarian problem.\\nAnd I just say this. This United States has tremendous problems of their own. We have infrastructure that we have to fix. We have bridges and roads and tunnels and everything is falling apart. Our nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in such trouble.\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why being a builder and a great builder and a very successful builder I think will greatly help.\\nBut we have so many of our own problems including the border, including the wall, which we will get built, including all of the things we have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 health care, which is a mess.\\nYou know, if you look at Obamacare, the premiums have gone up 45%, 50%, 55%. People are saying \"This is turning out to be a disaster.\" Deductibles are through the roof. The deductibles on Obamacare it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s through the roof.\\nSo we have a lot of problems. We have to take care of our vets. We have to build up our military.\\nJust the other day, Gen. [Ray] Ordierno said that the Army is in the worst shape in its history in terms of preparedness.\\nNow, for them to be in bad shape with the way we are and with the world hating us, and you look at Hillary Clinton \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve said she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the worst Secretary of State in the history of this country.\\nNow, in all fairness, because of the agreement that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about to be finalized with Iran, John Kerry may very well take her place.\\nI think that agreement is a disaster for this country, for Israel, for the Middle East. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to lead to nuclear proliferation \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the 24-day clause \\xe2\\x80\\x93 everything about it. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even get our prisoners back. You say who negotiates a thing like that?\\nThat won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen, I can guarantee you, with a President Trump.\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see it later. Yeah. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to hear it.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6I would say very simply I just want to be treated like everybody else.\\nYou see, I was always the fair hair boy. I was a big contributor. Nobody knows the system. But I was on the other side. And I was the elite. I was the fair hair person.\\nOnce I ran, all of a sudden I was a little bit of an outsider. I became an outsider because I was running. Because I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t supposed to run.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99m this businessman that people have given me great credit as being a great businessman. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not supposed to be running for office.\\nThe fact is that our country is being killed on trade by China, by Japan, by Mexico both at the border and on trade.\\nAnd I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not knocking those countries. Their leaders are much, much smarter than our leaders. They are absolutely killing us.\\nChina \\xe2\\x80\\x93 taking our jobs, taking our money, taking our base. And think of this: We owe China $1.4 trillion and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re paying them interest.\\nWe owe Japan with all of the cars coming in the same amount \\xe2\\x80\\x93 $1.4 trillion.\\nNow, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like a magic act. They send the cars in, they take our jobs, they do everything, and we owe them money. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen with me.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6Well, Jeb Bush is a very nice man. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be honest. I think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very nice person. I think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very low energy person and I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what the country needs.\\nI hear he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to spend a lot of money on negative ads on me.\\nAnd honestly, look, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s getting the money from special interests. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s getting the money from lobbyists and his donors. And they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re making him do it because he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s crashing in the polls.\\nSo I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to happen if he spends $20 million or $25 million on negative ads \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. I know that my life will continue. I just don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. I mean nobody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ever spent money on ads against me. But he probably has to do that although it would not be the way I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done.\\nYou know, one of the things I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m most honored about is that so far everybody that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attacked me has gone down the tubes.\\nYou have Lindsey Graham attacked me. He was at 3%. Now he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s at zero.\\nYou have Perry attacked me. Now he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s getting out of the race. He was at 4% or 5%. Now he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s getting out of the race. He was at zero.\\nEverybody \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Rand Paul attacked me. I see the last poll \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the Monmouth poll that just came out today where I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m leading by double figures and Rand Paul is down to less than 2% and he attacked me.\\nNow, Jeb Bush also just went down in the Monmouth poll very big.\\nSo I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. Are they going to spend \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to spend lobbyist money and special interest money. Remember this \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they have total control over Jeb and Hillary and everybody else that takes that money.\\nNobody knows the system better than me. They have total control.\\nYou understand it very well because you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been covering it for a long time. Those people that are putting up those millions of dollars have total control over your candidate.\\nI will tell you this: Nobody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s putting up millions of dollars for me. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m putting up my own money.\\nIn fact, I feel a little bit foolish. People are offering me millions and millions of dollars. You know, when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in first place, you can collect so much money and I keep turning them down. I feel like \\xe2\\x80\\x93 am I a fool? I feel very foolish.\\nAnd when I was in Iowa last week, I said \"What do you think? Can I take \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \" One man offered me \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a big lobbyist \\xe2\\x80\\x93 offered $5 million for my campaign. I said to the crowd in Iowa \\xe2\\x80\\x93 great crowd, 4,000 people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I said \"Can I take it? And would you believe I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to do anything? I promise you. I swear to you I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do anything.\" And they all stood up and said \"No, no, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take it.\"\\nThe fact is I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the only self-funder. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m putting up my own money.\\nI know there have been some super PACs \\xe2\\x80\\x93 5 or 6 super PACs \\xe2\\x80\\x93 where people are forming super PACs for Trump. I have nothing to do with them. As you know, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not allowed to have anything to do with them. So I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do.\\nHopefully, if they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do something it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be nice. But I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know anything about them.\\nBut just in a nutshell, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m funding my own campaign. Nobody else\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.\\nWhen people advertise \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I hope the voters can see this. Every negative ad they see about me is paid for by lobbyists and special interests. So just remember that.\\nOur country could be doing much better. We have deficits that are enormous. We have all bad trade agreements. We have an Army that the heads said is not prepared. We have a military that needs help and especially in these times.\\nWe have nuclear weapons that you look at 60 Minutes they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even work. Okay? If anybody saw that report. The phones don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re 40 years old. They have wires that are no good.\\nNothing works. Our country doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work.\\nEverybody wins except us. We need victories in this country. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have victories any more.\\nOur country will be great again, but right now our country has major problems.\\nI think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great that she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s [Carly Fiorina] in the debate. I was in favor of her being \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I think she should be in the debate.\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like the fact that there are 11 people now as I understand it. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not getting rid of Rand Paul or somebody. But I think they should because there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too many people.\\nBecause when you have 11, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not getting to hear me and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not getting to hear other people talking and I think that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too bad. I think 11 is a lot of people.\\nBut I was very happy that she got into the debate because frankly she deserves to be in the debate.\\nI think maybe he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s [Joe Biden] inclined not to get in the race. I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to depend on what happens with Hillary Clinton.\\nA lot of people think that she will not be able to make it legally from a criminal standpoint to the starting gate. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that to be true.\\nBut I think it depends on what happens with her.\\nI think if she gets out, he will get in. I think if she stays in, he might not.\\nWho knows?\\nOh, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not supposed to be here because he was here, he was up in my office and he got the pledge and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re very happy about that. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want anything \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I told him. I said, \"I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appropriate Reince for you to be here because I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want anything \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \" You know, you guys will end up saying he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s endorsing Trump.\\nSo I suggested frankly that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m fine with him not being here because I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want anybody to think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s endorsing.\\nAs far as Jeb is concerned, I watched him this morning on television and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a little bit sad.\\nDon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget. He was supposed to win. And he just doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the energy.\\nBut what he does have is a lot of money that was given to him again by special interests, donors, and lobbyists.\\nAnd I just hope that if he spends money on ads, which he may not \\xe2\\x80\\x93 if I were him, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d spend money on positive ads about himself. Because if he knocks me, assuming people leave and maybe they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re at a point where they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to leave because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re fed up with what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening in this country, but I think they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to go to people other than Jeb.\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. Right now, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m interested in jobs. One thing \\xe2\\x80\\x93 one of the groups, it was actually CNN. I shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say that. But they did a very massive poll and I came out number one in leadership, number one on the economy, number one in jobs producing.\\nAnd I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean by number one. I mean like number one by many, many times. And I am so intent on putting people back to work in this country.\\nYou know, we have 93 million people that are not in the workforce right now. 93 million.\\nWhen they give up looking for a job, they take them off of the stats. They take them off the statistics. We have 93 million people.\\nWe have 50 million people between poverty levels and welfare and all.\\nOur country can be great again. We have to put people back to work.\\nWould I bring my children into the administration? I will tell you they are very capable. The answer is probably not. But having them in would be very good. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re very, very capable children.\\nThe second part I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bother asking you. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no longer pertinent.\\nKanye West? You know what? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never say bad about him. You know why? Because he loves Trump. He loves Trump. He goes around saying \"Trump is my all-time hero.\" He says it to everybody.\\nSo, Kanye West \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I love him. Now, maybe in a few years I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to run against him. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know. So I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take that back.\\nBut he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been so nice to me.\\nYou people have sort of seen because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been a counter-puncher. I only hit people when they hit me. Only. And Kanye West has been so great. I would never say bad about him because he says such nice things about me.\\nNo, my supporters are really supporting me because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very competent, because they know that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to let China rip us off. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not going to let Japan rip us off.\\nJapan is devaluing their yen. Very hard for Caterpillar and other companies to compete against Komatsu \\xe2\\x80\\x93 their big tractor maker \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and others. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to let this happen anymore.\\nThey do \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you talk about a trade imbalance. They have in Japan the biggest ships you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen pouring cars into Los Angeles, pouring them in. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never seen anything like it. We send them beef and they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even want it.\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to end and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to like us.\\nIn this building, I have the largest bank in the world. Right up these elevators. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a bank from China. By far the biggest bank in the world.\\nI get along great with China. I get along great with Japan. I get along great with Mexico.\\nI love the people. I love the people of Mexico. I love the Hispanics. I have thousands of Hispanics right now working for me. Over the years, I have employed tens of thousands of Hispanics \\xe2\\x80\\x93 many from Mexico. I have unbelievably great relationships.\\nAnd in the package that we gave you, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll see there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a poll and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m number one with Hispanics. You saw that. Number one with Hispanics.\\nSo, look, for our country to be great, we have to be able to make great deals. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be great to the vets. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be terrific. Our military is going to be unbelievable.\\nAll of these things \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get rid of Obamacare and come up with something that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s much better and much less expensive. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get rid of it. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to repeal it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be out. Should have been out a long time ago. Should have never happened.\\nBut we are going to take care of our country and we are going to bring back jobs and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to bring back wealth to the United States so we can afford to save Social Security, which I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll save without cuts, so that we can afford to do the kind of things that we have to do to make America great again.\\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you very much. And here is your pledge.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to tell you a story about Nashville. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not even going to believe it. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very personal story. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very special place to me for a very special reason.\\nBut maybe more importantly, we have an incredible woman with us. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 92 years old. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk about age but she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 92. And she looks magnificent. And her name is Beada and she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s become very famous. You know who Beada is, right?\\nBeada, where are you Beada? Look at her. So beautiful.\\nSo, she just registered to vote for the first time in her life. She hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen anybody that really did it to her. And for the first time in her life she just registered to vote and she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to vote for Trump. I think, right?\\nThank you, darling. I really appreciate it. You know, she\\xe2\\x80\\x99s become so famous. She\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on television all over the world now.\\nI have to be nervous even talking to her, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re so famous. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great.\\nBeada, thank you very much. I really appreciate it and everybody appreciates it.\\nBecause there is a big, big growing like leaps and bounds silent majority out there and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take this country back and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make this country so great again and so strong again.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6Well, I just want to tell you about Nashville. So, years ago \\xe2\\x80\\x93 many years ago \\xe2\\x80\\x93 like I hate to say 40 but I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say 40 but close to 40, I came to Nashville. Did you ever hear of a company called Genesco? Genesco. Right? So, they were based in Nashville, Tennessee, and they owned the Bonwit Teller department store chain.\\nAnd I was a young guy and I came from Brooklyn in Queens, and I wanted to go into Manhattan. And I went into Manhattan and I did the Grand Hyatt Hotel and I did some other things that were good.\\nBut the thing I wanted more than anything was Fifth Avenue between 57th and 56th Street, which is called the Tiffany Location right next to Tiffany. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I wanted. I wanted that piece of property so badly.\\nI shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say that because you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not supposed to want things like that so badly. God will get angry at me, right?\\nBut I wanted it so badly and the company that owned it was Genesco based in Nashville, Tennessee.\\nAnd I came in and I came to Nashville, and I met with the heads of Genesco who were really great people actually. And they were having a lot of difficulties. There were a lot of fighting and a lot of everything.\\nAnd I convinced them to sell me the land and the building. And I bought the Bonwit Teller store Fifth Avenue from 57th to 56th street surrounding Tiffany. I bought all the air rights and then ultimately I bought the air rights from Tiffany and I built Trump Tower. And to this day it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the great buildings of the world and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the great successes.\\nAnd I love country music and I went to the Grand Ole Opry while I was here. And I just had such an incredible experience.\\nAnd when it came down to speaking because we could speak at a lot of places \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leading in every poll, they sort of want you. When you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not leading in the polls, like so many of these guys, they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want you at all.\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll talk about the polls in a second.\\nBut I had a lot of choices for this morning, and I guess I could have also gone and played golf like the President does all the time, right? But I decided let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s do this.\\nAnd I really chose Nashville because the experience is one of my \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not my biggest deal but in terms of a deal it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so important and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been such a great \\xe2\\x80\\x93 from the day I built it it was a home run. And it all really took place because of Nashville, Tennessee. So, I really \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an honor to be with you folks, I can tell you. Real honor.\\nSo, coming over I heard and I watched television \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, they have all these cameras back there and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re live. And I guess we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re live on CNN, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re live on so many different things. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always difficult. You know, when you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re always live, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to change up your speech. You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make the speech over and over\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\nThe other candidates don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get covered live ever, except for the debate.\\nSo you know, they had 24 million people on the debate. Now they think when the new numbers come out they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be even substantially higher than that.\\nSo I would\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve said they would have had a million or two. So I say they have 24 million people. And I say, well now the second debate, which is on CNN \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that was on Fox, maybe I should ask for a lot of money and give the money to charity. Does that make sense? All to charity. All to charity.\\nWhen I said that to the writers at Time Magazine, they were nice enough to put me on the cover with actually a nice story. And I said, you know, and I sort of thought I said it off the record but they put it in Time Magazine. So now \\xe2\\x80\\x93 maybe should I ask for charity, maybe a nice Nashville charity and American Cancer Society and AIDS research \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so many of this \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so many good \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Alzheimer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so many things going on. Maybe I should ask for a lot of money or I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not showing up.\\nYou know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interesting. So they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll get 2 million \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a million to 2 million people at the debates. You know, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been doing them for a long time. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do great, especially the early Republican debate. Like you know the expression \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it draws flies? That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what it draws.\\nSo this was one of the biggest shows in the history of cable television. I think it might have been the biggest in terms of political in the history of cable television.\\nNaturally I took full credit for it, which in all fairness I should. I should.\\nSo bottom line I think I might ask for a lot of money for charity but you know. But I did say is it a little hokey if I do that? Maybe it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not so nice. So what do you think? Should I do it or not? Maybe not. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know.\\nHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the thing. If I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it, CNN just makes a lot of money. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care about CNN. Honestly. No, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make a lot of money. They just shut off their camera.\\nThey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re actually very nice.\\nBut they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make a lot of money and, you know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s something we should consider. So we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll all consider it together.\\nBut coming over today, I saw that they were having the illegal immigrants come in and somebody mentioned the term the DREAMERs having to do with children and, you know, the dreams of children. And these are people who come over to the country and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re DREAMERs.\\nAnd I said, \"What about our children?\" Why can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t our children that are in the country, why can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they be the dreamers? Nobody ever talks about that. No, no, nobody ever talks about that.\\nYou know, we talk about the DREAMERs, we talk about illegal immigrants, who by the way are treated better than our vets.\\nYou know, our vets are incredible. No, no, the illegal immigrants in many cases\\xe2\\x80\\xa6are treated better than our veterans who are the greatest people we have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our wounded warriors are \\xe2\\x80\\x93 these are the greatest people we have.\\nAnd another thing nice about being able to make speeches without having to hire some guy to write and keep writing and reading it and put a teleprompter then say, \"Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Nashville, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wonderful \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \" you know, is that I can sort of be very current. Okay? I can be very, very current. I can talk about what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening.\\nThis morning on the television, they had a whole story about the Veterans Administration and the hospitals how people are waiting on lines to get in. These are our veterans. These are the people that got hurt fighting for us. Maybe we wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be here if it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t for them, to be honest with you. I mean, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible too.\\nThey had a story this morning on Fox, on CNN and a number of them where the veterans are just treated terribly and they showed a desk where there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supposed to be people behind this desk and they showed this desk and there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nobody there. And the veterans \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know, probably some of you saw it, the veterans are saying \"Where are the people?\"\\nAnd then, they said, \"What happened?\" And they said, \"This happens all the time.\" There was not even \\xe2\\x80\\x93 nobody even there! And two weeks ago on Wednesday, they had the longest wait in the history \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in the history of the Veterans Administration for people wanting to see a doctor.\\nWhen I go to a doctor, if I have to wait like 9 minutes, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m like \"Get me \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \" I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d go crazy. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true.\\nRemember the old days when the doctor used to come to your house? Right?\\nBeada remembers that. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have a cold. The doctor would come over carrying a little bag like this big, beautiful little bag, being at the top. And he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d come over to your house, check you out, fine. Those days don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exist anymore.\\nYou know, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in age of Obamacare where nothing exists.\\nBy the way, we will repeal and replace Obamacare. That I can tell you. That I can tell you.\\nBut, so two weeks ago Wednesday, the longest wait in the history of the Veterans Administration. So that if you go to the doctor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office, men and women are waiting four days, three days, one was five days.\\nOne case was five days or six days, finally got to see the doctor and the doctor excused himself because he was going on vacation.\\nNow, you think about that. Can you imagine waiting even a day or a half a day? But these people are waiting four, five days.\\nSo the wait\\xe2\\x80\\x99s now the longest in history and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the way we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re treating our greatest people and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not right and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to change that. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to change that.\\nWe have right now \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know this. You know, they see these phony statistics put out by politicians basically. All talk, no action politicians. And I mean on both sides in all fairness.\\nYou know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a Republican. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a conservative. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m just as angry with the Republicans because they go to Washington, something happens \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they become weak. You know, they go to Washington \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to stop Obamacare. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to stop this. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do this. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do that.\"\\nThen they walk into these magnificent buildings with those incredible vaulted ceilings, and they go \"Oh, I made it, darling, I made it. I vote for you. I vote for you. I vote for Obamacare expansions. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do whatever you want me to do. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in Washington.\"\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amazing. Isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t it amazing? Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you agree?\\nI won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t happen to me, I promise.\\nAnd if it does, you can let me know about it. But it won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. I promise. I promise.\\nBut you know, they show those phony statistics where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re 5.4% unemployment. 5.4%. The real number. You know, I actually saw a number it could be 42%, okay, believe it or not.\\nBut when you think about it, we have 93 million people that are right now out of the labor force. 93 million people. Of the 93 many of these people want jobs. And they quit looking.\\nSo if you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for a job and you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t find it and you stop for a while \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, after a while you sort of like \"It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not happening. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not going to happen.\" I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what they do. But they stop. They are considered statistically employed. Okay?\\nSo, we have 93 million people out of the labor force. I mean, think about it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to believe.\\nWe have 50 million people in poverty. These are very new numbers. 50 million people in poverty. Taking our money.\\nJapan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s taking our money.\\nMexico is beating us at the border and on trade. By the way, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re killing us on trade. You know that.\\nIn fact, you just lost a big car plant to Mexico in Tennessee. Remember? Recently front page Wall Street Journal. A plant that you were going to have\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\n[Comment on a supporter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sign]\\nYou know this is a movement, folks. This is not like maybe even about me. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want it to be about me. This is about common sense. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s about doing the right thing.\\nOne of the things that came out in the poll, which was really amazing. Some of the polls, I mean, hey, in Iowa, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leading big. Those are great people. We just left Iowa. We had such an amazing evening. 4,000 people in a room that never had that many people and it was a happening.\\nWe just left Alabama, which was unbelievable. 31,000 people in a stadium, and it was supposed to pour. And it did. It poured the minute my speech \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like luck. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s from God. The minute the speech was over, we got it and it poured. We had 31,000 people and it was the most unbelievable.\\nAnd the poll just came out in Alabama, leading big in Alabama. Leading big in Iowa. Leading tremendously big in New Hampshire. Great people. Leading really big in New Hampshire.\\nLeading big in Florida. How about Florida? I have a governor. We have a low energy governor and we have a Senator and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re leading big in Florida. How do you do that when you have a Senator who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sitting, you have a governor who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been there for eight years and Trump \\xe2\\x80\\x93 ? I love Florida and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m there a lot. What could be in Florida? Great weather. You have great weather but Florida has great weather. Big advantage.\\nBut you know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m leading big in Florida.\\nBut one of the polls came out because in South Carolina and North Carolina, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m leading really big.\\nAnd in South Carolina, a poll came out and we had a statement that my level of popularity or favorability \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the only one that can get a poll and it comes out and these guys in the back with all those red lights on will say \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I think I had one poll where I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m 41% \\xe2\\x80\\x93 almost 41% \\xe2\\x80\\x93 can you imagine? 41%. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 17 people. So I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m at 41% with 17 people and they said \"Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s at 41% but look\" \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even hear it. You know, \"Trump says bleh\". Nobody knows what they just said.\\n\"But there are some people that don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like him.\"\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unbelievable. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the only one that wins these polls and I get negative publicity. No, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s incredible. The press, ayeyayay.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6Well, yesterday, you might have seen me. I was in South Carolina. I made a speech. I had to bring it up.\\nThe New York Times to me is a big deal. You know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m from New York. Very liberal paper but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s okay. You know, not everybody could be like us. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still the New York Times. Right? We have to admit, still the New York Times.\\nAnd I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m on the front page a lot on the New York Times, and to be on the front page of the New York Times is a big deal.\\nBut yesterday or two days ago, they had story about me and they had some low level Hispanic commentator. Low level guy. This one didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like me.\\nBy the way, I think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to win the Hispanic vote and I think \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, in Nevada, I won the Hispanic poll. They love me.\\nI love the Hispanic people. Incredible energy. Incredible people. I love the people. I have so many \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I have thousands that work for me and thousands and thousands over the years and have worked for me. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re great people.\\nAnd I said, \"I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to win\". And a lot of the Hispanics that are here legally, they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want people coming in illegally. You know it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true.\\nSo there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s this poll that comes out. I think it was in South Carolina where we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re way up and Lindsey at 4% and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the Senator. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m at 30%. So I wrote him a note, \"Congratulations. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m only beating you in your home state by 26 points.\"\\nSo anyways, who cares.\\nBut they did something that nobody reported. They say, \"Oh but do people like Trump?\" By the way, this election is not going to be like.\\nI think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a nice person. I love people. I want to help people.\\nWomen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s health issues to me are very important. To Jeb Bush it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t important because he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to fund them. And then he said, \"Oh, I misspoke.\"\\nBut you know, I really want to be a nice person and I am a nice person.\\nBut I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actually going to be an election based on competence. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re tired of being like the patsy for everybody. I really do. I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time.\\nBut in the poll, this was the Monmouth poll. Big poll. Highly re \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"In another act of political magic\\xe2\\x80\\xa6Trump managed to flip his favorability rating from negative\" \\xe2\\x80\\x93 nobody wrote this by the way. Nobody said it. Nobody reported it. \"From negative to positive.\"\\nThis is an exact quote. I have like this photographic memory so I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but I want to be sure because if I used the word \"the\" incorrectly, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say, \"He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"\\n\"Favorability rating from negative to positive in one poll during the span of a month\". A feat that Monmouth University\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Patrick Murray\\xe2\\x80\\x99s highly respected pollster called \"astounding\".\\nCalled it \"astounding.\" Nobody else wrote about it.\\n\"That defies any rule in presidential politics that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen,\" said this highly respected man.\\nMurray, the director of the polling institute, said he flipped it from 20% to 52% in one month and he said that he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s never seen that before.\\nAnd you know what? That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because people have heard me and they say \"You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re such a nice person.\" No, they want \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they say he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a man \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve made a tremendous amount of money. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had tremendous success. And I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say that braggingly. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the kind of thinking we need in the country. I mean, whatever it is.\\nBut to me, that statement was more important than actually literally killing everybody in the poll. We were much, much higher, more than double everybody.\\nAnd we are more than double everybody.\\nYou saw the Quinnipiac just came out and that was an amazing poll. I was the same thing. Much, much higher \\xe2\\x80\\x93 double and triple and quadruple many of these candidates.\\nAnd the reason is people in this country are smart. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe a lot of what they see in the media because if you believe these people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, why are they doing this? I mean, why are they even saying it?\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99d think that if somebody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good for the country \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be great for the country because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to make great deals for our country. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win anymore. Our country doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t win anymore.\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99d think somebody \\xe2\\x80\\x93 even a liberal person or a Democrat liberal and I mean, really liberal. Somebody who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to make the country \\xe2\\x80\\x93 why are they knocking it? Why are they knocking? Why do they fight?\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99d think they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d say \"Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s do it. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good for all of us.\"\\nBecause our country is in trouble. We owe now $19 trillion. You know, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been saying $18 [trillion] for a while now. But now it starts to go up quickly.\\nAnd by the way, when Obamacare kicks in, which is really kicking in in \\xe2\\x80\\x9916, you want to see bad deficits? You want to see it go up? You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to really see it go up because that has a huge negative impact not only on jobs but on the deficit itself because of the costs. And it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no good.\\nHave you noticed \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen it yourself \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the premiums have gone through the roof? Right? The deductibility \\xe2\\x80\\x93 unless you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re close to death, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re never going to use it. You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use it because the deductibility is so high.\\nBut the premiums are up 30%, 40%, and 50% and more. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a disaster.\\nAnd on top of that, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to cost the country a fortune. So it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not only costing you a lot of money, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to cost the country a fortune.\\nSo we have to do something about it. And we have to do something importantly about it.\\nBut when I see the people on television and I have to tell you I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mention names, some of them when they hear my name \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I was talking \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we have a great reporter today from the Wall Street Journal with us. Okay? Who came down. And she actually said \"Some of them when they hear your name it looks like they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a boiler waiting to explode.\" It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6Now, number one, they look bad because they said \\xe2\\x80\\x93 do you remember the beginning? Like three, four months ago. They said, \"He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a clown. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a clown. Just having fun.\"\\nYou know, I went to a great school. I did great. I did \\xe2\\x80\\x93 everything was great. I came out. I made a fortune, which I want to use the brain for you, but I made a fortune.\\nI then did a book called The Art of the Deal and many bestsellers. The Art of the Deal being probably the best selling business book of all time. Who has read The Art of the Deal? Yeah, most people. Most everybody.\\nI jokingly say but I mean it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the Bible tops it by a long way. I say that. I say that. Said it the first time in Iowa. People liked that. But it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. Nothing tops the Bible.\\nBut the Art of the Deal \\xe2\\x80\\x93 great success. Many books \\xe2\\x80\\x93 bestsellers. Many, many bestsellers.\\nThen I do The Apprentice. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never done television. I do The Apprentice. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one of the most successful shows ever on television by the way.\\nAnd NBC renewed the Apprentice. You know that. Right? For me.\\nThey came up to my office, the head of Comcast \\xe2\\x80\\x93 great guy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use names. Just say \"Steve\". No, honestly he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great guy. One of the best in the country. He came up with the heads of NBC six months ago and they said, \"Donald, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re renewing The Apprentice. Please, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to do \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you have to do it.\"\\nI said, \"Honestly, Steve, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m running for President. I want to make our country great again. I want to make -\"\\nAnd they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe me. And I said it four times. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe me. Nobody believed that I was going to run. Nobody.\\nMy wife didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even believe me, but now she does. But she actually said \"If you actually say you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to run, you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to do great because people like you.\" She actually said \"They\\xe2\\x80\\x99d love you\" but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to brag. But she said, \"If you actually run \\xe2\\x80\\x93 not you may run, you may not run, who knows?\" But she said \"If you actually say -\"\\nSo the NBC guys come up \\xe2\\x80\\x93 terrific people. I mean, honestly I had a great relationship with NBC for 12 years. We had many, many, you know number ones and The Apprentice continues to do great. You know, last season you know how well it did. So they wanted to renew it for many, many shows.\\nIn fact, Mark Burnett called up. You know Mark Burnett. He did Survivor, Apprentice. So Mark Burnett, who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great guy, he calls up and he goes \"I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not taking a renewal.\" The word is renewal. I said, \"That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right, Mark. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to run for President.\" \"No, no, no, you have to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 nobody doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t take a renewal. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unheard of in primetime television. Two hours primetime. Are you crazy?\" I said, \"Mark, I have to do this. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done so well in this country. I have to do it.\"\\nWe can save our country. We can save our country.\\nSo anyways, the bottom line, NBC renewed it. I told them I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not doing it, and then they finally believed me when I actually announced.\\nThey don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like me anymore. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s amazing. They do not like me.\\nBut it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too bad. Too bad. Well, thank you.\\nYou know, the funny thing about The Apprentice \\xe2\\x80\\x93 there have been 15 copies of The Apprentice. Every single one of them failed. So then a reporter said to me, \"Why do you think that is?\" I said \"Because I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m special.\" And I was kidding. I was doing it sarcastically \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I mean, I sort of meant it to be honest, right? But I was sort of kidding. And they wrote it and I hated the way it looked in writing. You know, it sounds good when you say it but oh it looks so bad in writing.\\nBut so I had a great experience. So here I am \\xe2\\x80\\x93 great schools, great brain, great success, built a great company, do The Apprentice, tremendous success. When I did The Apprentice, a certain critic said \"It will never be successful\" because you know to have a big hit \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a really a number one hit \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you have to \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and you remember that first season it had one of the highest ratings ever. The finale of The Apprentice? Aye! Remember with the great Bill Rancic. Remember how that was? Incredible. But to have a great success, you have to have women.\\nAnd I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never forget \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I saved the article. Right? Like Harry Truman saved it where it said, \"Truman loses\" and he actually won. Remember? But I saved this article. They said \"Trump can never succeed on television because why would women want to watch Donald Trump?\" And I said, \"Am I so bad? Am I so bad?\" Tell me, am I so bad?\\nAnd it turned out that women were the biggest base. I mean, those were the ones that liked\\xe2\\x80\\xa6So you know I saved those things.\\nBut no matter how you cut it, we can do something so incredible. And honestly, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be hard. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be a lot of work. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be a lot of time. I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t leave the White House. You know, Obama always leaves the White House. Think of it. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re elected President. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re in the White House. Why would you want to leave? I think I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d maybe never leave! How cool is that?\\nHe leaves to go to some place and go fundraisers. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll try \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know maybe there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s some rules against it. So maybe I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll do the fundraisers in the White House.\\nHe and his wife left \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I think one was doing the Ellen show another was doing another show right next door in Burbank, California. They left a couple of hours difference. One took Air Force One; one took a beautiful Boeing 757. Two planes. A little bit different timing going to the same location, going to the same airport to do different shows.\\nAnd I say why? Why aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they flying at least the same plane?\\nNow, I know what those suckers cost because I happen to have one of them right? So I know what it costs to operate these planes\\xe2\\x80\\xa6More importantly, the time and the energy. But I would have said Ellen or I would have said whoever was doing the show, \"Let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s do it from the White House.\" This way, I take a half and hour, I go back, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t spend any money of the taxpayers.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6And you know the funny thing is that whoever the host is would like it better. \"We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing our show live from the White House or something\".\\nSo we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t pay any money. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to fuel up Air Force One, which costs you \\xe2\\x80\\x93 do you ever see what it costs to travel in these things? With hundreds and hundreds of security and you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re closing down Burbank, California.\\nI mean, every time Obama comes to Manhattan to do a fundraiser, which is often, I say \"What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on? You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t move. They closed down all the streets. They closed down the city.\"\\nAnd he could do it from like Washington. In fact, he could do it in my new hotel that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m buying which is only a couple of blocks.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m building this incredible hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to be incredible. The Old Post Office. And I actually got it from the Obama administration, which is hard to believe. People say \"What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on? How did Trump get it?\"\\nOne of the most heavily sought after buildings in the history of the General Services Administration, which owned it. You know, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the ones that made the decision. And I got it and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re building this phenomenal hotel \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Trump International Hotel \\xe2\\x80\\x93 right on Pennsylvania Avenue directly between Congress and the White House. Right? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to open just in time \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and by the way, listen to this one. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re under budget and ahead of schedule. Do you ever hear that from government? Way under budget.\\nSo we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re actually going to be opening and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be great. But he can use my hotel. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll let him use it free. You just come in, use it, go back to the White House. But you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to do that.\\nBut you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d say to yourself why \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a mindset. But more importantly even in the travel, we have so many things that we have to do to straighten out our country. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to waste time. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to do this. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to make deals.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got the greatest deal makers in the world lined up to make deals for us. Carl Icahn \\xe2\\x80\\x93 incredible guy. Right? Incredible guy. Great deal maker.\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got some of the greatest deal makers in the world. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all calling me too. They said \"You didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t ask me.\"\\nI have these guys calling me up \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the best in the world.\\nNow, I know the best. I also know guys that are overrated. I know guys that you haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t heard of that honestly are phenomenal. I know a lot that you have heard of that aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really that good, that are overrated in my opinion.\\nBut they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re the best in the world. And they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re calling me. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want money. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re worth billions of dollars.\\nBut when I put, let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s say, Carl Icahn and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say \"Carl, do me a favor. Handle China.\" We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make a great deal. No, no, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make a great deal because that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what happens. You know, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what happens.\\nSo, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take back our trade.\\nIf you look at China, if you look at Japan \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I was in Los Angeles a few weeks ago. I saw ships \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the biggest ships I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen with cars pouring our, pouring out one after another, made in Japan, very nice. Everything\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nice. Except that it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t help us. When does it help us? When does it help us?\\nWe sell them beef. Beef. And then they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want it. Because you know, do you ever see what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on over there? We sell the beef and it goes over there and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very perishable. So by the time it gets over there, then they turn it over \"We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want it.\"\\nThey have cars coming from these massive, massive ships. Massive. And they just pour off the ships.\\nAnd I say, \"What are we doing? How stupid are we? No tax, no nothing.\"\\nAnd I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a free trader. I believe in free trade. I have to say. But I have to be fair trade.\\nWhen you look at Japan, they take in money up here and we give them money down here. We get nothing by comparison. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like peanuts.\\nBalance it out, fellows. Balance it out. Got to balance it.\\nA friend of mine is a great manufacturer. As you know, China has \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably the greatest theft in the history of the United States what China has done to us. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve taken our money. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve taken our jobs. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve taken everything. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve taken so much.\\nAnd they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re creating a bubble and you know interestingly we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re so intertwined that now the bubble could take us down if it explodes, which at some point it might.\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to be smart.\\nI made so much money dealing with China. I made hundreds of millions, probably billions, dealing with China.\\nThe Bank of America building in San Francisco \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I own a big chunk of that, which nobody knows. Nobody knows.\\nYou know, all these guys come to Forbes. \"Oh, Trump\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth only $5 billion or $4 billion.\" Or whatever. \"He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only worth $5 billion.\" It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like a bankrupt magazine\\xe2\\x80\\xa6They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know my numbers. They said, \"Well, we haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been able to look at about 400 of his companies.\"\\nSo I filed. Interestingly, they said \"He\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never run. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never run.\"\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6Then I announced. Then they said, \"Oh, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never file his form whatever.\" That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a single page where basically you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re signing your life away and it has to be done within 14 days of the announcement.\\nI signed my form. And they said, \"Well, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never ever put in his financials.\" And you have like 90 days or something. And they said, \"He\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll ask for extensions but he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never show because he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably not as rich as people think.\"\\nBut actually I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m much richer and I put in my financials \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true.\\nAnd Forbes and another group said, \"No, no, we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what these companies are.\"\\nI put in these massive financials, and you know, I was so proud. I might have filed if I wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t going to run. I wanted to show people. I wanted to brag. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s such a great company I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve built.\\nSo they said, \"He\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never put in his financials.\" I put in the financials. And everybody \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re much bigger. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a much bigger \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, very little debt, tremendous value. And really great assets. Iconic assets. You know, iconic. Doral, Turnberry in Scotland. I mean, I have some of the greatest real estates in the world. And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m very proud of it.\\nBut they say, \"He\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never file. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never file.\"\\nThen they see all these companies. And you know, they have boxes. And because it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really meant for somebody like me, and they have these little boxes. They say, \"Is it worth or does he make $1 million, from $1 million to $5 million, from $5 million to $10 million, from $10 million to $20 million?\" The last box is $50 million or more. $50 million or more.\\nSo like I have a lot of buildings that are worth much more than that. I have a lot of assets that are worth much more than that.\\nSo it says \"$50 million or more\". So I checked many of them. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how many. I think there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 23 of them. Can you believe it? So I checked like, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know, I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 23. I could be wrong. Oh, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll kill me if I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m wrong. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure. But I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like 23 boxes. $50 million or more.\\nSo you know when some of these guys do to try and always marginalize you? They added up 23 50s. Now, some of the 50s are worth a billion. Some of them are worth more than a billion.\\nSo it says \"$50 million or more\", I go 50. So they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll take $50 million for a building that might be worth a billion and honestly much more.\\nAnd they add them up and they say \"Well, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s worth $2.9 billion.\" It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this is the press. And they have no clue. Those statements aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really meant for me \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not meant for a guy like me.\\nBut with all of that the statements were so good. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re so good. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re so good.\\nAnd you know, one of the things I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m doing and last night was incredible. We had an amazing event in Massachusetts. Right? Oh, look at this, we have a wit- what the hell are you doing in Nashville? What are you doing?\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6Anyway, so here I am. I spent millions of dollars during the course on jet fuel. Okay? Like a lot of money on jets.\\nBut somebody puts up a sign $100 to go to this thing. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know who did it. But somebody puts up a sign.\\nSo all over the place, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m spending millions of dollars. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m turning down millions. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want your money. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want your money.\\nSomebody puts a sign up talking about $100 contribution, which you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to make. But they put it up. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all over CNN. \"Trump is asking for $100.\"\\nI fly my plane some place it costs me a fortune. The fuel. The $100. The money that I raised last night, which says it all it goes towards paying off like the expense or something. The guy that had it is a great guy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Ernie. A great guy. Really successful guy. You know him, right? Ernie. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll sell you a car any day of the week, right?\\nAnd you know the guy is \\xe2\\x80\\x93 like 2,000 people showed up. Let him get a little deferment of the roast beef or whatever the hell they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re serving.\\nSo they put up a sign. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want the money. I might like $4 or $5 million. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to turn down. But the hundred dollars times some people and we let the vets there, we let most of the people I think came in free. And I end up with this big story \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"Trump accepting contributions\".\\nI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe it. I got so angry at my people. Because somebody put up a sign saying $100. And honestly, first of all, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like peanuts. It doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean anything. But they used to it to try and marginalize. They always do. They always do.\\nThe bottom line is I am self-funding my campaign. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m self-funding. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to have anybody giving. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need money. Now, with that being said, the small money comes in and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a lot of money but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s great money. Like Beada might send me some money. Beada will send me some money.\\nBut a woman sent me $7 with a beautiful letter from Georgia. Another person sent me $12. Small money. And some sent me $1,000. But it doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t amount to a lot. But that I do like coming in because they invest in the campaign.\\nHow do I take the $7 check, right, and send it back to the person who sent it to me from Georgia? \"Dear So and So, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sorry I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t really want your money.\" How do you write a letter like that?\\nI want them to invest in it. You know, but they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re not going to tell me not to do this or not to do that for China because they are lobbyists for China and they gave me $5 million.\\nI had a big lobbyist asked me to have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he wanted to give me $5 million for my campaign. I turned him down. I turned him down.\\nAnd then I see this story on CNN last night. It was disgusting. That look there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a sign \\xe2\\x80\\x93 $100! Somebody does a sign. It actually was a beautiful sign if you want to know the truth. It was so beautiful. It was beautifully done. And they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing this big thing about all day long last night about \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I said we had this incredible event and they destroyed it by trying to marginalize. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the press. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the media.\\nYeah, the criminal media. I mean, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s truth to it. No, because a lot of times they know it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wrong.\\nBut I just want to tell you so important to me and last night it was such an incredible event. It had to be a record for a house. The guy got a beautiful house, got a big lawn, put up a tent. But we had 2,000 people. It had to be a record.\\nThe spirit in that group, the spirit in Alabama, the spirit was so incredible. The spirit in our last meeting in Iowa. Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t forget.\\nWhen I went to Iowa and you know what I love? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m leading with Tea Party. Big. I love Tea Party. I love the Tea Party. Tea Party people, stand up and take a bow. You have not been treated fairly. No, you haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been treated fairly.\\nYou have not been treated fairly.\\nYou know, people talk about the Tea Party and you talk about marginalizing, at least I have a microphone where I can fight back. You people don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\nThe Tea Party people are incredible people. These are people that work hard and they love the country and then they just get beat up all the time by the media. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disgusting.\\nAnd you will be surprised how big you are. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how big you are. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know the power that you have. I mean it. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know the power that you have.\\nThe Tea Party and you can call it anything that you want. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t care about names. But the Tea Party has tremendous power.\\nI talked silent majority. But the silent majority is more than Tea Party. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Democrats. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s poor people. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rich people. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s everybody. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s evangelicals.\\nOne of the things that made me so happy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a protestant. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a presbyterian. Right? \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is that I had a recent poll and they did a beautiful \\xe2\\x80\\x93 like these polls are great. You know, guys like Jeb Bush and Hillary, they hire pollsters. They pay them hundreds of thousands of dollars. What do you have to do that for? Every week they come out with a new poll. Right?\\nHey, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m rich. I could hire a hundred poll. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to waste money. You know, why should I pay?\\nI know in one case\\xe2\\x80\\xa6like $150,000 a month. And you know, then they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re arrogant guys. They think they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re hot stuff and they tell the candidates what to say. \"You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to say this. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to be politically correct.\"\\nNo way. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have time to be political. No, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true.\\nI don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have time to be political. You know, it takes a lot of time to be politically correct.\\nYou saw the anchor baby thing. Did you see that with where I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m on? And somebody from\\xe2\\x80\\xa6it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the same network \\xe2\\x80\\x93 CNN again \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he said, \"You know the name anchor baby is very insulting?\" I said, \"What would you call it?\" And he gave me like nine words. \"A baby of illegal immigrant who was brought to the country to this and that.\" I said, \"How can I say that? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too long.\"\\nIt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anchor baby.\\nAnd then Bush \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Jeb. Jeb Bush gets caught because he is such a nice person. Honestly.\\nIf you want a nice person, honestly you should vote for Jeb. The country is going to go to hell but we won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t talk of that. No, no, but if you want a nice person.\\nSo Jeb has a memo that he signed of basically a politically correct memo. You know, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say this, don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say that. All these things. Pages of stuff.\\nBut one of the things \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"Never use the term \\xe2\\x80\\x98anchor baby\\xe2\\x80\\x99.\"\\nSo all of a sudden, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s using the term anchor baby just last week.\\nAnd with me, when I use it nobody criticizes me. They expect me. They gave up. Okay?\\nWith him, they killed him. They just killed him. It didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop.\\nAnd then he blamed it on the Asians. He said, you know \\xe2\\x80\\x93 did you see that? And then the New York Times did an editorial \"How dare you attack the Asians?\"\\nSo he wanted to steer away from the Hispanics. He said, \"Well, you know, the Asians come in and they also have anchor babies.\" And now the Asians all hate him. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true.\\nBut the Asians love me and I love them. I love them.\\nSo he has a memo and he signs the memo and it says \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a couple of years ago \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use this term\", and now he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s using it because he has to.\\nBecause baby \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, think of it. Think of it. I want to build a wall. Okay? So easy. So easy. When this clown \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Jose Reyes or whatever the hell his name \\xe2\\x80\\x93 no, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a baseball player. Ramos. Actually Jose Reyes is a baseball player. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a nice baseball player. But when Ramos got up the other day screaming and ranting and going crazy and I had all these reporters. Actually, the reporters were mostly on my side because they all had their hand up but this guy starts screaming.\\nSo I even had liberal people from CBS \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I actually said to the CBS guy \"Yes?\" and this guy stands up and starts screaming.\\nSo when he \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and I actually got a lot of credit for the way we handled him. I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do anything like \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do anything. Except for the Times. And that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what I alluded to before. The Times said, \"Donald Trump railed at him and screamed at him.\" I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t scream at him. But he was screaming at me.\\nAnd much worse than that, they said I wore a toupee. Can you believe it? I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wear a toupee, and I proved it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bring anybody up. I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bring anybody up. But I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\nBut think of it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m in the front page of the New York Times and in the first sentence in the first paragraph has this announcer \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this Hispanic announcer that nobody ever heard of \\xe2\\x80\\x93 saying they called him something which means he wears a toupee. And I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\nSo, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m on the front page of the New York Times. I can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even talk about it. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m embarrassed to talk about it.\\nBut they also said, I was essentially screaming at this guy from Univision, who I happen to be suing for $500 million. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mention that.\\nThey also didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mention that his daughter works for Hillary Clinton. Did you know that? His daughter works for Hillary Clinton. Oh, you didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that. Oh. No, they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mention that. No, no.\\nThey said I was wearing a toupee and I was screaming but they didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. No, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s screaming at me.\\nSo we very nicely \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and then we let him come back and we actually had a nice talk. He actually seemed like a nice guy after he calmed down a little bit. You know, he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a very emotional man.\\nBut, he said, \"You can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t build a wall because you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do it.\"\\nSo, 2,000 years ago in China \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we always get back to China \\xe2\\x80\\x93 2,000 years ago, the Great Wall of China \\xe2\\x80\\x93 oh, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to have a wall. This is a serious wall. Okay? This is a wall you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go through so easy.\\nThey built a wall 2,000 years ago that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 13,000 miles. Think of that. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a big wall. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s serious wall, right? This was 2,000 years ago. I mean, it took them like 500 years to build it so you know, I got to be a little bit \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, took a long time. But 13,000 miles that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a long time. They had no tractors. They didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have Caterpillars.\\nOf course, today, we use Komatsus because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re made in Japan and you could buy them cheaper. How stupid is that? Because they devalued the yen so much and people are buying Komatsus instead of Caterpillars. Caterpillar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stock is down. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s terrible. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll change that around. Believe me. Believe me.\\nBut, they build this wall. Now, we have really 15 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I would say \\xe2\\x80\\x93 look we have 2,000 miles as opposed to 13,000. But you don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need it on all of it because some you have natural landscaping, some you have a lot of places.\\nAnd actually 10 years ago, everybody wanted the wall built. Hillary wanted it built. But they couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t.\\nBecause I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a great builder. What I do best is build. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not a rendering guy. I do the building and then do the rendering. A lot of these guys come in with renderings and it never gets built. Does that make sense to anybody? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m the opposite. I get it built.\\nSo, one of the reasons it couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get built is because they couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get an approved environmental impact study. Do you believe this? No, no, they had certain snail doggers and different things. They couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get it. They could not get an environmental impact study approved to build a wall.\\nAnd they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re killing people. We have illegal immigrants. You see that with Kate in San Francisco. You see it with Jamiel. You see it with so many people.\\nLast night in Massachusetts I met some unbelievable families that have been devastated by illegal immigrants. They come into this country and kill members of their family.\\nLast week in California, a 66-year-old veteran \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a female, a veteran, 66 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 got raped, sodomized, tortured, and killed. Raped, sodomized, tortured, and killed. 66-years-old. By an illegal immigrant that they caught, that they caught luckily.\\nBut this is what we have. We have stupid people in our government and we have people pouring across the border. And you know what? We have great border patrol people. I went there. You probably saw that. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why the hat is so successful. The white one, right?\\nBut I went there, everybody wants to buy the hat. Now they like the white one. Then two weeks later, I wore the red one. The white one didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sell so well. The red one sells. Crazy thing.\\nBut I went to the border and I got to know the people and I saw people, and you know it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rough stuff, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rough stuff.\\nAnd when I first came in and when I first did my opening statement that I was running for President, I talked about illegal immigration. I was killed by the press.\\nRush Limbaugh, who I think is a terrific guy, said \"Trump has received more incoming than any human being I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen. Then he goes and has a news conference and I think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to apologize and he doubles down.\"\\nI got credit. I got credit.\\nNo, they thought I was going to apologize. And I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mind apologizing but I have to make a mistake to apologize and I was right. No, I was right.\\nSo for two weeks, as Rush said, I took incoming\\xe2\\x80\\xa6In fact that was my first two weeks. I said \"Is it going to be like this for the next year and a half?\" I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know if I can make it. It was brutal.\\nNow, many of those people that talked that way, many of those people, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve apologized to me. Everybody says I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m right. And only because of me is everybody talking about illegal immigration. They wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even be talking about it. They wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even be talking about it.\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to build a wall and we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get, you know, the gang members in Baltimore and in Chicago and these are some tough dudes. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be out so fast.\\nOne of the first thing I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to do is get rid of those gang members. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, you look at what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on with Baltimore, you look at what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going on in Chicago and Ferguson and St. Louis the other night. We are going to get rid of those gang members so fast your head will spin.\\nYou know, we can be very tough. I just met your cops outside. Those police are tough cookies. Those guys \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we need law and order. We need law and order.\\nI mean, they allowed \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in one night, that first night in Baltimore \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they allowed that city to be destroyed. And they set it back 35 years. One night. Because the police were not allowed to protect people. They weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t allowed to protect people.\\nWe have incredible law enforcement in this country and we have to be \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the head of the police in Chicago is a person I know. Originally from New York. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a phenomenal guy. He can stop things if they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re allowed to stop them. He can stop it. Believe me.\\nWe have some incredible people. But we have to be tough. We have to be smart.\\nYou know, I know you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have some bad apples. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have problems. I see some of the things. You did too and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disgusting and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s horrible. But that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s such a tiny percentage.\\nThe problem is the good work doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get shown on television. All of the good work, which is 99.9%.\\nI mean, the good work with the police. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 99.9%. That one little thing.\\nAnd it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s horrible. I agree. I hated some of the things. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to go into them. But you know the same ones because you were sick when you looked at some of them just like I was.\\nBut we need law and order. We need our police. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re great people. They do a phenomenal job. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re right now afraid of doing anything. They\\xe2\\x80\\x99re afraid.\\nI mean, I know cities. I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mention names but I know cities where police are afraid to even talk to people because they want to be able to retire and have their pension; they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to be thrown off the police force.\\nAnd then you wonder why there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s crimes in our cities.\\nSo we need a whole new mindset. We have to build up our military. We have to make our military so strong. We have to make our military so powerful and so strong that we never have to use it. We never have to use it.\\nWe also have to focus on what we have \\xe2\\x80\\x93 look, Ukraine. I want Ukraine to be healthy, vibrant and good. But Ukraine is near Germany and all of these European countries. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re now sending F-22s. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the newest fighters. The best in the world. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re sending fighters every \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Where\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Germany? Where are all these European countries? It affects them. It affects them. And we want to stand alongside of them. I agree.\\nBut why are we leading the fight? Putin hates us. He hates Obama. He doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hate us. I think he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like me. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d get along great with him I think if you want to know the truth. No, he has no respect for our President and our President doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t like him in all fairness. They don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have good chemistry to put it mildly, would you say. But I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d get along with these people.\\nThink of it. Every country is ripping us off. Even Russia is ripping us off because in the Iran deal, which is going to go down as one of the worst deals ever, Russia is a big beneficiary because they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to sell Iran missiles with the money we give to Iran. Think of that.\\nSo one of the biggest beneficiaries is Russia. Okay?\\nBut think of it. So, Ukraine \\xe2\\x80\\x93 let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s take a few of these things and then I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m getting the hell out of here; I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going back to New York. Do you mind? Maybe I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll go to the Grand Ole Opry tonight. Can I do that?\\nI\\xe2\\x80\\x99d actually rather \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I love \\xe2\\x80\\x93 by the way, this is not a politician speaking. Believe me. I hope. I love country music. I love it. Hey, Trace Adkins \\xe2\\x80\\x93 right? And who else won on The Apprentice? Who else? John Rich. My kids love those two guys. John Rich. And who else? Who did really well? Clint Black. Right? Clint Black. He did great. And my Trace \\xe2\\x80\\x93 how good is Trace, okay?\\nYou know, Trace came onto The Apprentice. And I said, \"Who the hell is he? Who is he?\" I didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know who Trace was. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d never heard of him. And he wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t a big name. And he came on \\xe2\\x80\\x93 just to show you how important this show is and his record or album or whatever you call it now\\xe2\\x80\\xa6it went to number one. And then he came to me the next year\\xe2\\x80\\xa6but Trace came to me and he goes \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, at certain awards show, I won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mention the name \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but he said \"Last year, I couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get into the show and this year I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m hosting it, Mr. Trump, all because of you.\"\\nNice, right? I know, nice.\\nBut those three guys, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re great and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re just fantastic people.\\nBut we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to make our country so strong. We have to make our country rich again.\\nA person came up and said, \"Oh, that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not nice.\" What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not nice? They said rich, you know, to say we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to make our country rich.\\nWe can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make our country great if we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to be poor. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a debtor nation. We owe $19 trillion.\\nChina \\xe2\\x80\\x93 think of this \\xe2\\x80\\x93 China we owe $1.4 trillion to. So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, they take our base, they take our manufacturing and we owe them $1.4 trillion. How do you do that? That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like a magic act. Right? It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true.\\nJapan sells us cars by the millions. They make a fortune. They come in, they sell us cars by the millions. And we owe them the exact same amount. We owe them $1.4 trillion. How come if they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re selling us cars we owe them money? Think of it. Put on your business. See? I have a natural instinct for this stuff. Right? You know? Right?\\nIf we buy all these cars, why do we owe them money? But we owe them because they take all our money that they make and they buy our bonds. And we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re paying interests on them and we owe them money.\\nSo, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll change. It can change. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not even going to be hard.\\nPeople don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t realize. See, Obama never read the Art of the Deal. People don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t realize.\\nOh, and somebody said Sharon. It was Sharon. Where\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Sharon? She gave me such a hard time. Where\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Sharon? Where the hell is she? You could have both Sharons stand up actually. Where are they? Both of them. Sharon is great. Oh, did they go after her\\xe2\\x80\\xa6She took a lot of incoming. Sharon, did you take a lot of incoming? I think so. Right? Thank you, darling.\\nSo, we are going to do something that if I get elected \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and again they said I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never run and now\\xe2\\x80\\xa6One guy said \\xe2\\x80\\x93 John McLaughlin \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you ever watch the McLaughlin Report? I like him.\\nAnd one of the people on the little group said Donald Trump is a great businessman but he\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never make it as a President. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never get elected. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never make it. And John McLaughlin \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this crusty guy who I like; I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know him. I never met him, I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think. But I like. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sitting there and he goes \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and he got angry \\xe2\\x80\\x93 he goes \"Why wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he make it? You tell me why. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been a tremendous success in everything he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s done. I go all over the world. I see him name. I see his name all over. He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a great success.\"\\nAnd he said \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I think this is the word \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \"He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a man of great achievement. Why wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t he make it?\"\\nAnd I thought it was so nice and the other guy just sort of shut up. You know, because you need somebody of great achievement.\\nYou need \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve produced tens of thousands of jobs over the year. I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to worry about Obamacare. I take such good care of my employees. I have thousands of employees. I take good care of them. We have great plans. My employees are lucky. They hit the lotto, okay? But I take great care \\xe2\\x80\\x93 education and health care \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and my people are very happy.\\nBut I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve done this for a long time, and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen ups and downs. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen market crashes. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve seen friends of mine go bankrupt. You\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never seen \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never gone bankrupt. By the way, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve used the laws to my advantage and companies.\\nI buy a company. I throw it into a chapter. I negotiate with banks. I kill. You know. And then they say \"Trump goes bankrupt.\" These people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nNow, when other people do that, when a Carl does it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I mean, they do it all the time. They use it all the time. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called using your head. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called using the laws.\\nActually I did a good job didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t I at the debate when Chris Matthews so angrily said \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I do what every other great businessman does.\\nI buy a company \\xe2\\x80\\x93 you know, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s one company was sort of interesting. A friend of mine had it. Good guy. And the banks were just killing him. They were mean. And banks can be mean, right?\\nYou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to teach them how to behave, right?\\nSo this guy was just getting beaten. And I did him a favor and I called up the banks. And I said \"Do me this, do this, do this, do that.\" They said, \"We won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that. No, we won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do that.\"\\nI said, \"You\\xe2\\x80\\x99re making a mistake.\" Anyways, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sort of a little bit complicated\\xe2\\x80\\xa6I bought it. Immediately, I called them back and said, \"Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do this.\" I threw it into a chapter. And they come out with the story \"Trump files bankruptcy\". Can you believe it? I negotiated it to hell. What I did to that bank \\xe2\\x80\\x93 ayeyeye.\\nThey see me walking down the street and they go \"Hey, hey, hey.\" But then I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m good at that stuff, you know? I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m really good at that stuff.\\nBut you have to use the laws to your advantage. No, no, you have to use it to your advantage.\\nAtlantic City. You know, you look at Atlantic City. Caesar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s went bankrupt. Whoever heard of Caesar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s? Caesar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s filed Chapter 11. Nobody cares. Everybody in Atlantic City. I had the good sense seven years ago and actually the financial media gives me great credit because I have a vision for things.\\nI said, \"Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go into Iraq\" even though I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a very militaristic person. I said \"Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t go into Iraq\" and they shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have because I said you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to destabilize the Middle East. So what did we get \\xe2\\x80\\x93 $2 trillion. Thousands of deaths. Thousands. Like 5,000. Wounded warriors who I love all over the place.\\nWe can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even go there. Iran is taking over Iraq. With the money that we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re giving them, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to take off and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get the oil, they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to get everything. The oil they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t get ISIS is getting. What do we get? Nothing. We get nothing. We got far less than nothing.\\nSo I had vision in 2004 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Reuters \\xe2\\x80\\x93 actually it was before that but they wrote a story. Trump says don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t do Iraq.\\nNow, I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m much more militaristic than Bush, even the brother. But you got to know where to use it and when. You got to use.\\nSo with Atlantic City, seven years ago, I got out. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s called vision. I should get credit for vision.\\nAnd again, this isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bragging. Normally, I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say this but I need your fricking votes. Do you understand that? Do you understand that?\\nI mean, normally I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. So I got great credit. I got out.\\nBut most of the places in Atlantic City are either in trouble or they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re bankrupt. They went bankrupt.\\nBut I made a lot of money in Atlantic City. I had a great time in Atlantic City but they asked me a nasty question, I gave a great answer. I thought. So I think I solved it.\\nListen, we are going to do things that are going to make you so proud if I win.\\nWe are going to have victories again. We are going to win.\\nIn fact, last night in front of the audience and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never said this before. Last night in front of the audience I said we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have so many victories.\\nAnd then I said we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win here. We\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win on trade.\\nWe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to win militarily in terms of not having wars but just having such great strength that nobody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to play with us. Nobody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to mess with us. Okay? Nobody.\\nAnd we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have victories. So many victories that are going to be coming out\\xe2\\x80\\xa6In fact, you might get tired of victories. You may not want anymore\\xe2\\x80\\xa6And everyone stood up and said \"No, no, no, we want to keep winning.\"\\nIf I win, we will have victories all over. We will win on trade. We will win on health care. We will win on everything.\\nI will protect your Social Security without cuts. I will protect your Medicare and your Medicaid. We are going to have something that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so special.\\nAnd you know, my whole fame is and I\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say it once. We will make America truly great again.\\nAnd thank you very much. Thank you everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much!\\nThank you, everybody. Great honor. Great honor, thank you. This is a wonderful day. On a Saturday morning yet. Isn\\'t that nice? Thank you, all. And we\\'re going to have an incredible convention. It\\'s really going well. We\\'re going to have an incredible convention. And we\\'re going to get things solved, and we\\'re going to do lots of wonderful things for our country, most importantly.\\nSo I\\'m here today to introduce the man who will be my partner in this campaign, and the White House, to fix our rigged system \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we are in a rigged, rigged system \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and to make America safe again and to make America great again.\\nI want to also address the Islamic terror attack in France. We\\'ve witnessed horror beyond belief, no matter where you look. And now it\\'s happening more and more. And it\\'s never going to stop.\\nWe need new leadership. We need new thinking. We need strength. We need in our country law and order. And if I\\'m elected president, that will happen.\\nI want to express our unyielding support for the people of France, and we mourn their loss as a nation.\\nAnd as far as Turkey is concerned, so many friends in Turkey, great people, amazing people. We wish them well. It looks like they\\'re resolving the difficulty, but we wish them well. A lot \\xe2\\x80\\x94 a lot of anguish last night, but hopefully it\\'ll all work out.\\nNow, as, hopefully, the next president of the United States, I want to refer back to what\\'s happened over the years. The Middle East today is more unstable than ever before. Never been like this. Out of control. After four years of Clinton, who really led the way and led Obama down a horrible path, because I don\\'t even think he could have made these decisions so badly, she led him right down a horrible path. He didn\\'t know what he was doing.\\nIraq, Syria, all into chaos. And Iran is on a path to nuclear weapons. And on top of that, we gave them back $150 billion, and we didn\\'t get our hostages until the end. Now we\\'re seeing unrest in Turkey, a further demonstration of the failures of Obama-Clinton. You just have to look, every single thing they touched has turned to horrible, horrible, death-defying problems.\\nWe also need to bring back in this country \\xe2\\x80\\x94 because we see what happened \\xe2\\x80\\x94 our industry, our manufacturing, our jobs. They\\'ve been taken away, like we\\'re babies. Taken away. And we\\'re going to bring them back.\\nI found the leader who will help us deliver a safe society and a prosperous \\xe2\\x80\\x94 really prosperous society for all Americans. Indiana Governor Mike Pence was my first choice. I\\'ve admired the work he\\'s done, especially in the state of Indiana. And I\\'m going to go over some of those accomplishments in just a minute.\\nBut I also admire the fact that he fights for the people, and he\\'s going to fight for you. He is a solid, solid person.\\nGovernor Pence served Indiana with distinction in Congress. He rose to leadership and served as the chairman of the entire House Republican Conference. Number one. He\\'s really got the skills of a highly talented executive, leading the state of Indiana to jobs, growth, and opportunity, in spite of the relentless obstacles put in his way and every state\\'s way by the Obama administration. It\\'s horrible out there. High taxes and regulations. And it\\'s out of control.\\nMike Pence is a man of honor, character, and honesty. We know that. Hillary Clinton is the embodiment of corruption. She\\'s a corrupt person. What she\\'s done with her e-mails, what she\\'s done with so many things, and I see the ads up all the time, the ads. She\\'s totally bought and paid for by Wall Street, the special interests, the lobbyists, 100 percent. She\\'s crooked Hillary.\\nAnd I think that, while she got away with murder, in fact, I think it might be her greatest accomplishment, escaping the recent scandal, and her lies, and the loss of 33,000 e-mails \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but it wasn\\'t a loss, she discarded \\xe2\\x80\\x94 that in itself is a major crime. Other people have been paying tremendous prices for what they\\'ve done, which is peanuts compared to what happened with Hillary Clinton.\\nThirty-three thousand e-mails are missing, and that\\'s OK? Didn\\'t give them to the FBI? Didn\\'t give them to the attorney general, and that\\'s OK? Wipes her server clean, that\\'s OK? These are crimes. These are crimes. And how she got away with it, I think I understand it, but I think a lot of people don\\'t.\\nBut I do believe, while she didn\\'t pay the price she should have paid, she\\'s going to pay that price when November 8th rolls around. She\\'s going to pay it at the polls. I believe that.\\nOn top of everything else, Hillary made $21.6 million giving speeches to special interests in a short period of time. She\\'s totally owned by Wall Street. We believe in Americanism; she believes in globalism. And it\\'s not that she believes in it. The people that give her all of this money believe in it. And she\\'ll believe in whatever they want her to believe. Believe me. That\\'s it.\\nWhat a difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and Mike Pence.\\nMike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy: Radical Islam. Radical Islamic terrorism. You saw it the other day with the truck screaming out the window. You heard what he was screaming out the window. You saw it in San Bernardino. You saw it at the World Trade Center. You saw it in Orlando. How horrible was that? You saw it in Paris. You see it all over.\\nAnd Hillary is a weak person. We are the law and order candidates, and we\\'re the law and order party. We\\'re going to change things around. There\\'s going to be respect again for law and order.\\nHillary Clinton\\'s foreign policy helped launch ISIS. You know, she\\'s talking \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I see the ads she puts on. If I make one statement, which is fine, she\\'ll take that statement and put on a totally dishonest ad, because she\\'s got a lot of money because it\\'s given to her by the lobbyists and by the special interests. Got a lot of money.\\nBut I see the ads on foreign policy. She\\'s talking about Donald Trump doesn\\'t have foreign policy experience. Of course not. I\\'ve been a very, very, very successful businessperson. I mean \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but if you look at my calls, I said, don\\'t go into Iraq. Nobody cared, because I was a businessperson. I was a civilian. Take the oil. Many, many calls I\\'ve made.\\nYou take a look. I said that in Scotland and in the U.K., that was going to happen. I was the one that predicted it. And everybody said, he\\'s wrong, he\\'s wrong. President Obama said, if it happens, they\\'re going to get to the back of the line, which probably is one of the reasons they lost, because I consider it a win. I think it was a win for them, actually, because they don\\'t want to be told what to do. And they don\\'t want to be told that when people pour into the country, they have to take them even if they\\'re not qualified, even if they don\\'t have paperwork, even if they have no idea where they come from.\\nAnd I said that Brexit\\'s going to happen. I said that they are going to break away. And everybody laughed at me. And the odds were 20 percent. And then when it happened, she took an ad saying, oh, Donald Trump said this or that, but I\\'m the one that said it was going to happen. And some of the more fair reporters \\xe2\\x80\\x94 about 30 percent of them \\xe2\\x80\\x94 said he was right. I appreciate that. Seventy percent didn\\'t, so that\\'s OK.\\nSo Mike Pence will never be afraid to speak the name of our enemy. So important. Now, I think if you look at one of the big reasons that I chose Mike \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and one of the reasons is party unity, I have to be honest. So many people have said party unity. Because I\\'m an outsider. I want to be an outsider. I think it\\'s one of the reasons I won in landslides. I won in landslides. This wasn\\'t close. This wasn\\'t close.\\nNow, this wasn\\'t close. This was \\xe2\\x80\\x94 in the history of the Republican Party, history, with 17 people running, you have to understand, other people ran against one, two, and three. There were 17. We got \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I say we, because I\\'m the messenger, I\\'m a messenger \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I\\'m doing a good job, but I\\'m a messenger \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we got almost 14 million votes. That\\'s more than any other person in the history of the Republican Party in the primary system running for president.\\nThink of it. That\\'s more than Ronald Reagan, who we love. That\\'s more than Richard Nixon. It\\'s more than Dwight D. Eisenhower. You know, he won the Second World War, in all fairness. Pretty good. It\\'s more than the Bushes.\\nBut I mean by a lot. I don\\'t mean by a little. But that\\'s with 17 people. People don\\'t over-say that. That means our message is unbelievable. And I want to thank all of the loyal people \\xe2\\x80\\x94 because I have such loyal, unbelievable people, and they displayed that just yesterday in Cleveland, where it\\'s going to be so amazing.\\nBut they displayed it. It was on display, where we had this group of people, who \\xe2\\x80\\x94 many of whom I\\'ve known, and I won\\'t say, because for party unity, I\\'ll say they\\'re wonderful people, OK? Never Trump, they said, never Trump, never Trump. Oh, we\\'re going to win. They got crushed. And they got crushed immediately, because people want what we\\'re saying to happen.\\nThey\\'re tired of a country that has horrible trade deals, that has no borders, that has taxes that are through the roof, highest taxed nation just about in the world, that has regulations that don\\'t allow you to start a business and destroy your business if you do start \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and, by the way, speaking of destroying businesses, we\\'re going to take care of the miners and we\\'re going to take care of the steelworkers. We\\'re going to put them back to work.\\nSo they\\'re very tired of it. But I want to thank all of those people that \\xe2\\x80\\x94 delegates that were on the different committees, because, boy, was that something. Did we show them something. And unfortunately, the vote was very late. But essentially, we had 112- 12. This was the vote that was going to put it onto the floor and we\\'re going to have a big fight. We\\'re not going to have a fight. People agree with what we\\'ve \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they want the wall. They want the borders. They want these things to happen.\\nAnd what we\\'re doing...\\nAnd what we\\'re doing that I\\'m so proud of, so proud \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and nobody else would even think about doing it \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I fought very hard for it. We\\'ll call it the Johnson amendment, where he took away from the evangelicals \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and I want to thank the evangelicals, because without the evangelicals, I could not have won this nomination. The evangelicals have been unbelievable. I dominated with the evangelicals. A lot of people were surprised. They say he\\'s not perfect. But you know what? They know I\\'m going to get the job done, and they\\'re really smart.\\nAnd I said \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and I said for the evangelicals, that we\\'re going to do something that nobody\\'s even tried to do. You have the Johnson amendment passed by Lyndon Johnson and his group. And he was a powerful president. He knew how to get things done. He got bogged down in a war that was a disaster and it destroyed him. But he was a powerful president.\\nAnd we call it the Johnson amendment, where you are just absolutely shunned if you\\'re evangelical, if you want to talk religion, you lose your tax-exempt status. We put into the platform, we\\'re going to get rid of that horrible Johnson amendment. And we\\'re going to let evangelicals, we\\'re going to let Christians and Jews and people of religion talk without being afraid to talk.\\nI saw this. I had so many great leaders so many times up to my office, the top \\xe2\\x80\\x94 the absolute top evangelical leaders, Christian leaders, Jewish leaders, believe it or not, some Muslim leaders \\xe2\\x80\\x94 people are going to be surprised to hear that \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I had the top leaders up to my office, and I said, why is it that you\\'re so powerful as an individual, and yet when you get out there, you\\'re sort of timid?\\nAnd they didn\\'t know how to answer the question. And it took two, three meetings before I figured it out. One great, great gentleman that everybody knows, but whose name I will not reveal, said, Mr. Trump, we live in fear in our churches and our synagogues. We live in fear that we\\'re going to lose our tax-exempt status if we say anything that\\'s even slightly political.\\nAnd I looked out the window. I was in Trump Tower, and I pointed to people walking down the street. I said, well, they have the right to speak, but you don\\'t. That means they\\'re more powerful than you are. We have to do something about it. How did it start? How did it start?\\nAnd they said, it started because of Lyndon Johnson. And he actually had a problem in Texas with a certain religious leader. And he did this, and he got it done. And we\\'re going to undo it, so that religious leaders in this country, and those unbelievable people, and not because they backed me in such large numbers, but so that religion can again have a voice, because religion\\'s voice has been taken away. And we\\'re going to change that. OK? All right.\\nBack to Mike Pence. So one of the primary reasons I chose Mike was I looked at Indiana, and I won Indiana big. Remember, Indiana was going to be the firewall. That\\'s where Trump was going to \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they agreed I\\'d win New York, I\\'d win Pennsylvania, I\\'d win all these places. But Indiana was going to be the firewall.\\nSo I got to study Indiana, and I got to study New York and a lot of other places, and I saw how NAFTA, signed by Bill Clinton, has drained our manufacturing jobs, just drained us like we\\'ve never been drained before. NAFTA, again, signed by Bill Clinton. NAFTA is the worst economic deal in the history of our country. Manufacturing down in some states 55 percent, 60 percent. It\\'s a horror show, moving to Mexico, moving to other places.\\nI have a friend who\\'s a great builder. What he builds is plants. That\\'s all he does, is build plants. He doesn\\'t build buildings. He doesn\\'t \\xe2\\x80\\x94 he builds plants. It\\'s the biggest in the world, from what I hear.\\nI said, how\\'s business? I was with him the other day. How\\'s business? He goes unbelievable. I said, really, wow, I\\'m surprised. Why is it unbelievable? Because I think of him as building in this country. He says, Donald, what we\\'re doing in Mexico, you won\\'t believe. I said, what do you mean? He said, we\\'re building plants in Mexico the likes of which we\\'ve never seen.\\nI said, what about this country? Not much. Not much. That\\'s the expression. He said exactly that. Not much. I said, but Mexico? He said, you\\'ve never seen anything like it. It\\'s incredible.\\nFolks, that\\'s going to stop. We\\'re going to go reverse it. We\\'re going to bring our jobs back to this country. We can\\'t be the stupid people anymore. OK?\\nAnd he was better than a pollster. He\\'s better than a consultant. I would say, how are we doing? And you get a big report that costs you millions of dollars. Doesn\\'t cost me millions. Me, I give them $10,000, OK?\\nIt costs other people millions. It costs other campaigns millions to get a report. Every time they get a report, it\\'s millions. But I\\'ll tell you what, a guy like this is better than anybody you can hire to do a report. And he said it. He didn\\'t say it from the standpoint of he\\'s upset about it. Just fact. How are we doing? Unbelievable in Mexico. In fact, he actually said, I\\'ve never, ever seen anything like it.\\nAnd if you look, Ford is building massive plants there instead of Michigan. We want them to build them in Michigan. They\\'re going to build them in Michigan. And you know that I know how to do that. So easy. So easy.\\nBut they\\'re not going to do and they\\'re not going to take advantage of us without retribution. There are consequences when you fire thousands of people and move to another country and then think you\\'re going to you\\'re your product and sell it in here. There are consequences. And those consequences are going to keep companies in our country. It\\'s very simple. And everybody here knows what the consequences are, but I won\\'t say that because I\\'m much more interested right now in Mike.\\nIndiana\\'s unemployment rate \\xe2\\x80\\x94 and this is the primary reason I wanted Mike, other than he looks very good, other than he\\'s got an incredible family, incredible wife and family \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Karen is amazing.\\nIncredible family. Highly respected. Expected to go for another four years. He would have won, I think, very easily in Indiana. Indiana, their unemployment rate has fallen, when he was there, when he started, 8.4 percent when he was governor, when he took over, to less than 5 percent in May of 2016. Since January 2013, Indiana\\'s labor force has increased by more than 186,000 jobs. You have to understand, I\\'ve gone around to all these states. I\\'ve gone to all of them. And every time, I have statisticians. I say give me the stats on a state.\\nAnd it\\'s always bad, down, down, down. Down 40 percent, 50 percent, 60 percent in some cases. Here\\'s somebody where it\\'s gone up. Private sector job growth is up by more than 147,000 jobs since 2013. That\\'s like very unusual.\\nGovernor Pence balanced the budget. Can you imagine a balanced budget? Our budget\\'s so out of whack in this country, we don\\'t know what we\\'re doing. We\\'re going to owe very soon $21 trillion. He balanced the budget. They don\\'t know what that means. Governor Pence balanced the budget, produced a surplus, and maintains a $2 billion reserve fund in the state of Indiana.\\nIt\\'s also rated AAA, their bonds are rated AAA. Very few states have that. AAA. The best. That\\'s as good as you can get, whether you\\'re a company, a state, AAA.\\nIndiana was recently recognized by Chief Executive Magazine as the number-one state in the Midwest for business. Number one. And it\\'s not even close. There are approximately 34,000 fewer Hoosiers on unemployment insurance now than there were when Mike Pence took office. So you have fewer Hoosiers, fewer people from Indiana.\\nAnd besides that, Bobby Knight, my friend, who really did help me. I mean, if you want a reference, Bobby Knight in Indiana, we love Bobby Knight. But he agrees with everything I\\'m saying. He loves the governor.\\nIndiana has the second-lowest unemployment rate in the nation, for veterans, where nobody\\'s fighting for the veterans like I\\'m fighting for the veterans, the veterans have been left behind.\\nIf you remember a few months ago, Hillary Clinton said really \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they\\'re doing much better, the V.A. is much better. They\\'re doing a much better job than people give it credit for. People are dying on line waiting for five, six days for doctors. People are dying on \\xe2\\x80\\x94 they can\\'t even see a doctor. It\\'s a scandal.\\nTake a look at what\\'s happening with the V.A. in Arizona. Take a look at what\\'s happening with \\xe2\\x80\\x94 you know, just the Veterans Administration hospitals. It\\'s a scandal. It\\'s corrupt. It\\'s incompetent. It\\'s a scandal. And Hillary Clinton thought it was just fine. And, boy, am I going to win big with the veterans. I mean, we know that for a fact.\\nSo it\\'s now 2.4 percent for veterans. In 2013, when Mike Pence took office, the rate for veterans was 6.7 percent. It was 31st in the nation, one of the bad ones, and now it\\'s almost the best. Got them jobs. Got them jobs.\\nIndianapolis is ranked second in top 10 metro areas for young college graduates. That\\'s a great thing. They\\'re going to stay there. That\\'s a great thing. And Mike worked hard on that. He was telling me, that was not easy.\\nUnder Governor Pence\\'s leadership, Indiana enacted the largest K- 12 education funding increase in the state\\'s history. So you\\'re balancing budgets, and yet you\\'re giving more money to education. Isn\\'t that a great thing?\\nIndiana has just about the largest school choice program in America. School choice is where it\\'s at, folks. You want to get your schools better, you better get rid of Common Core fast.\\nGovernor Pence enacted the largest income tax cut in the state\\'s history. Think of that. We\\'re cutting taxes and balancing budgets. And along with corporate tax reform, just about number one in the country. CNBC ranked Indiana first in the nation for its infrastructure.\\nSo with all of these cuts and all of these balancing budgets, we\\'re spending more money on education, and the infrastructure is kept up. That had so much \\xe2\\x80\\x94 look, as a builder, nobody in the history of this country has ever known so much about infrastructure as Donald Trump. I build infrastructure. Do I know how to build a wall? Do I know how to build infrastructure?\\nYou know, it\\'s very interesting. We\\'re building \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we\\'re building \\xe2\\x80\\x94 I won the \\xe2\\x80\\x94 which is pretty amazing with the Obama administration, but I won the right to have the old post office building on Pennsylvania Avenue, right near the White House, and it\\'s an amazing \\xe2\\x80\\x94 probably the best location, one of the most sought after projects in the history of the GSA, General Services. And I really like what\\'s happened.\\nWe\\'re going to have an opening very soon. Ivanka and Eric and Don did a fantastic job on it.\\nBut I thought the other day, I was going over the numbers, we\\'re under budget and about a year \\xe2\\x80\\x94 actually more than a year \\xe2\\x80\\x94 we\\'re a year ahead of schedule, and we\\'re under budget substantially. And the quality of the work is even better than we originally were going to do.\\nAnd when I explained to a government representative that we\\'re under budget and ahead of schedule, they almost fell off, because they\\'ve never heard those words before. They\\'ve never heard them.\\nSo when I see what happened to Indiana, which was having tremendous problems, when I see what happened to Indiana under Mike\\'s work \\xe2\\x80\\x94 also his predecessor did a great job, by the way, great job, who\\'s now at Duke \\xe2\\x80\\x94 who\\'s now at Purdue \\xe2\\x80\\x94 when I see what happened with respect to the numbers, the state, and everything else, that, to me, was probably the single most important point, because it\\'s something that hasn\\'t happened \\xe2\\x80\\x94 almost has not happened in this whole country.\\nThe turnaround and the strength of Indiana has been incredible, and I learned that when I campaigned there. And I learned that when I won that state in a landslide. And I learned that when Governor Pence, under tremendous pressure from establishment people, endorsed somebody else, but it was more of an endorsement for me, if you remember. He talked about Trump, then he talked about Ted \\xe2\\x80\\x94 who\\'s a good guy, by the way, who\\'s going to be speaking at the convention, Ted Cruz, good guy \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but he talked about Trump, Ted, then he went back to Trump. I said, who did he endorse?\\nSo even though he was under pressure, because I\\'m so, you know, outside of the establishment, it was the single greatest non- endorsement I\\'ve ever had in my life, OK? I will tell you.\\nSo with that, I would like to introduce a man who I truly believe will be outstanding in every way and will be the next vice president of the United States, Governor Mike Pence. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you.\\n\\nIt is great to be here. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99d like to thank Alumisource and all the amazing workers here for hosting us. Today, I am going to talk about how to Make America Wealthy Again.\\nWe are thirty miles from Steel City. Pittsburgh played a central role in building our nation.\\nThe legacy of Pennsylvania steelworkers lives in the bridges, railways and skyscrapers that make up our great American landscape.\\nBut our workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 loyalty was repaid with betrayal.\\nOur politicians have aggressively pursued a policy of globalization \\xe2\\x80\\x93 moving our jobs, our wealth and our factories to Mexico and overseas.\\nGlobalization has made the financial elite who donate to politicians very wealthy. But it has left millions of our workers with nothing but poverty and heartache.\\nWhen subsidized foreign steel is dumped into our markets, threatening our factories, the politicians do nothing.\\nFor years, they watched on the sidelines as our jobs vanished and our communities were plunged into depression-level unemployment.\\nMany of these areas have still never recovered.\\nOur politicians took away from the people their means of making a living and supporting their families.\\nSkilled craftsmen and tradespeople and factory workers have seen the jobs they loved shipped thousands of miles away.\\nMany Pennsylvania towns once thriving and humming are now in a state despair.\\nThis wave of globalization has wiped out our middle class.\\nIt doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have to be this way. We can turn it all around \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and we can turn it around fast.\\nBut if we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to deliver real change, we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re going to have to reject the campaign of fear and intimidation being pushed by powerful corporations, media elites, and political dynasties.\\nThe people who rigged the system for their benefit will do anything \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and say anything \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to keep things exactly as they are.\\nThe people who rigged the system are supporting Hillary Clinton because they know as long as she is in charge nothing will ever change.\\nThe inner cities will remain poor.\\nThe factories will remain closed.\\nThe borders will remain open.\\nThe special interests will remain firmly in control.\\nHillary Clinton and her friends in global finance want to scare America into thinking small \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and they want to scare the American people out of voting for a better future.\\nREAD: How Donald Trump Says He\\xe2\\x80\\x99d Win America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Trade War\\nTop U.S. Labor Leader Blasts Donald Trump in Dueling Speeches\\nMy campaign has the opposite message.\\nI want you to imagine how much better your life can be if we start believing in America again.\\nI want you to imagine how much better our future can be if we declare independence from the elites who\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve led us to one financial and foreign policy disaster after another.\\nOur friends in Britain recently voted to take back control of their economy, politics and borders.\\nI was on the right side of that issue \\xe2\\x80\\x93 with the people \\xe2\\x80\\x93 while Hillary, as always, stood with the elites, and both she and president Obama predicted that one wrong.\\nNow it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time for the American people to take back their future.\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the choice we face. We can either give in to Hillary Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign of fear, or we can choose to Believe In America.\\nWe lost our way when we stopped believing in our country.\\nAmerica became the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dominant economy by becoming the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dominant producer.\\nThe wealth this created was shared broadly, creating the biggest middle class the world had ever known.\\nBut then America changed its policy from promoting development in America, to promoting development in other nations.\\nWe allowed foreign countries to subsidize their goods, devalue their currencies, violate their agreements, and cheat in every way imaginable.\\nTrillions of our dollars and millions of our jobs flowed overseas as a result.\\nI have visited cities and towns across this country where a third or even half of manufacturing jobs have been wiped out in the last 20 years.\\nToday, we import nearly $800 billion more in goods than we export.\\nThis is not some natural disaster. It is politician-made disaster.\\nIt is the consequence of a leadership class that worships globalism over Americanism.\\nThis is a direct affront to our Founding Fathers, who wanted America to be strong, independent and free.\\nOur Founding Fathers Understood Trade\\nGeorge Washington said that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe promotion of domestic manufactur[ing] will be among the first consequences to flow from an energetic government.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAlexander Hamilton spoke frequently of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexpediency of encouraging manufactur[ing] in the United States.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe abandonment of the protective policy by the American government\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 must produce want and ruin among our people.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nOur original Constitution did not even have an income tax. Instead, it had tariffs \\xe2\\x80\\x93 emphasizing taxation of foreign, not domestic, production.\\nYet today, 240 years after the Revolution, we have turned things completely upside-down.\\nWe tax and regulate and restrict our companies to death, then we allow foreign countries that cheat to export their goods to us tax-free.\\nAs a result, we have become more dependent on foreign countries than ever before.\\nLadies and Gentlemen, it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time to declare our economic independence once again.\\nThat means reversing two of the worst legacies of the Clinton years.\\nAmerica has lost nearly one-third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 even as the country has increased its population by 50 million people.\\nAt the center of this catastrophe are two trade deals pushed by Bill and Hillary Clinton.\\nFirst, the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. Second, China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s entry into the World Trade Organization.\\nNAFTA was the worst trade deal in history, and China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s entrance into the World Trade Organization has enabled the greatest jobs theft in history.\\nIt was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA in 1993, and Hillary Clinton who supported it.\\nIt was also Bill Clinton who lobbied for China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disastrous entry into the World Trade Organization, and Hillary Clinton who backed that terrible agreement.\\nThen, as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton stood by idly while China cheated on its currency, added another trillion dollars to our trade deficits, and stole hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property.\\nThe city of Pittsburgh, and the State of Pennsylvania, have lost one-third of their manufacturing jobs since the Clintons put China into the WTO.\\nFifty thousand factories across America have shut their doors in that time.\\nAlmost half of our entire manufacturing trade deficit in goods with the world is the result of trade with China.\\nIt was also Hillary Clinton, as Secretary of State, who shoved us into a job-killing deal with South Korea in 2012.\\nAs reported by the Economic Policy Institute in May, this deal doubled our trade deficit with South Korea and destroyed nearly 100,000 American jobs.\\nAs Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVoted for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nTrade reform, and the negotiation of great trade deals, is the quickest way to bring our jobs back.\\nTo understand why trade reform creates jobs, we need to understand how all nations grow and prosper.\\nMassive trade deficits subtract directly from our Gross Domestic Product.\\nFrom 1947 to 2001 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a span of over five decades \\xe2\\x80\\x93 our inflation-adjusted gross domestic product grew at a rate of 3.5%.\\nHowever, since 2002 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the year after we fully opened our markets to Chinese imports \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that GDP growth rate has been cut almost in half.\\nWhat does this mean for Americans? For every one percent of GDP growth we fail to generate in any given year, we also fail to create over one million jobs.\\nAmerica\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cjob creation deficit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d due to slower growth since 2002 is well over 20 million jobs \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just about the number of jobs our country needs right now to put America back to work at decent wages.\\nThe Transpacific-Partnership is the greatest danger yet.\\nThe TPP would be the death blow for American manufacturing.\\nIt would give up all of our economic leverage to an international commission that would put the interests of foreign countries above our own.\\nIt would further open our markets to aggressive currency cheaters. It would make it easier for our trading competitors to ship cheap subsidized goods into U.S. markets \\xe2\\x80\\x93 while allowing foreign countries to continue putting barriers in front of our exports.\\nThe TPP would lower tariffs on foreign cars, while leaving in place the foreign practices that keep American cars from being sold overseas. The TPP even created a backdoor for China to supply car parts for automobiles made in Mexico.\\nThe agreement would also force American workers to compete directly against workers from Vietnam, one of the lowest wage countries on Earth.\\nNot only will the TPP undermine our economy, but it will undermine our independence.\\nThe TPP creates a new international commission that makes decisions the American people can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t veto.\\nThese commissions are great Hillary Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Wall Street funders who can spend vast amounts of money to influence the outcomes.\\nIt should be no surprise then that Hillary Clinton, according to Bloomberg, took a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cleading part in drafting the Trans-Pacific Partnership\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\nShe praised or pushed the TPP on 45 separate occasions, and even called it the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgold standard\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\nHillary Clinton was totally for the TPP just a short while ago, but when she saw my stance, which is totally against, she was shamed into saying she would be against it too \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but have no doubt, she will immediately approve it if it is put before her, guaranteed.\\nShe will do this just as she has betrayed American workers for Wall Street throughout her career.\\nHere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how it would go: she would make a small token change, declare the pact fixed, and ram it through.\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why Hillary is now only saying she has problems with the TPP \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin its current form,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 ensuring that she can rush to embrace it again at her earliest opportunity.\\nIf the media doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe me, I have a challenge for you. Ask Hillary Clinton if she is willing to withdraw from the TPP her first day in office and unconditionally rule out its passage in any form.\\nThere is no way to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfix\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the TPP. We need bilateral trade deals. We do not need to enter into another massive international agreement that ties us up and binds us down.\\nA Trump Administration will change our failed trade policy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 quickly\\nHere are 7 steps I would pursue right away to bring back our jobs.\\nOne: I am going to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which has not yet been ratified.\\nTwo: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to appoint the toughest and smartest trade negotiators to fight on behalf of American workers.\\nThree: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going to direct the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers. I will then direct all appropriate agencies to use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses.\\nFour: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m going tell our NAFTA partners that I intend to immediately renegotiate the terms of that agreement to get a better deal for our workers. And I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean just a little bit better, I mean a lot better. If they do not agree to a renegotiation, then I will submit notice under Article 2205 of the NAFTA agreement that America intends to withdraw from the deal.\\nFive: I am going to instruct my Treasury Secretary to label China a currency manipulator. Any country that devalues their currency in order to take advantage of the United States will be met with sharply\\nSix: I am going to instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China, both in this country and at the WTO. China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO, and I intend to enforce those rules.\\nSeven: If China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets, I will use every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes, including the application of tariffs consistent with Section 201 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.\\nPresident Reagan deployed similar trade measures when motorcycle and semiconductor imports threatened U.S. industry. His tariff on Japanese motorcycles was 45% and his tariff to shield America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s semiconductor industry was 100%.\\nHillary Clinton, and her campaign of fear, will try to spread the lie that these actions will start a trade war. She has it completely backwards.\\nHillary Clinton unleashed a trade war against the American worker when she supported one terrible trade deal after another \\xe2\\x80\\x93 from NAFTA to China to South Korea.\\nA Trump Administration will end that war by getting a fair deal for the American people.\\nThe era of economic surrender will finally be over.\\nA new era of prosperity will finally begin.\\nAmerica will be independent once more.\\nUnder a Trump Presidency, the American worker will finally have a President who will protect them and fight for them.\\nWe will stand up to trade cheating anywhere and everywhere it threatens an American job.\\nWe will make America the best place in the world to start a business, hire workers, and open a factory.\\nThis includes massive tax reform to lift the crushing burdens on American workers and businesses.\\nWe will also get rid of wasteful rules and regulations which are destroying our job creation capacity.\\nMany people think that these regulations are an even greater impediment than the fact that we are one of the highest taxed nations in the world.\\nWe are also going to fully capture America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tremendous energy capacity. This will create vast profits for our workers and begin reducing our deficit. Hillary Clinton wants to shut down energy production and shut down the mines.\\nA Trump Administration will also ensure that we start using American steel for American infrastructure.\\nJust like the American steel from Pennsylvania that built the Empire State building.\\nIt will be American steel that will fortify American\\xe2\\x80\\x99s crumbling bridges.\\nIt will be American steel that sends our skyscrapers soaring into the sky.\\nIt will be American steel that rebuilds our inner cities.\\nIt will be American hands that remake this country, and it will be American energy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 mined from American resources \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that powers this country.\\nIt will be American workers who are hired to do the job.\\nWe are going to put American-produced steel back into the backbone of our country. This alone will create massive numbers of jobs.\\nOn trade, on immigration, on foreign policy, we are going to put America First again.\\nWe are going to make America wealthy again.\\nWe are going to reject Hillary Clinton\\xe2\\x80\\x99s politics of fear, futility, and incompetence.\\nWe are going to embrace the possibilities of change.\\nIt is time to believe in the future.\\nIt is time to believe in each other.\\nIt is time to Believe In America.\\nThis Is How We Are Going To Make America Great Again \\xe2\\x80\\x93 For All Americans.\\nWe Are Going To Make America Great Again For Everyone \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Greater Than Ever Before.\\nThank you.\\n'}"
